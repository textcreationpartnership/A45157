         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SECOND DISCOURSE UPON Re-ordination.</head>
            <p>HAving met with a certain Book of ſome worthy perſon, under the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and an unknown name, with <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on my Diſcourſe about Re-ordination, I perceive the Lord is pleaſed to call me forth to a new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upon this ſubject, for the ſake of my Brethren, unto whom I am already engaged. It is a truth, this author hath from <hi>Mirandula, Non eſt in potentia hominis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere aliquid apparere intellectui ſuo verum quando,</hi> or <hi>quia vult,</hi> and when I find ſo ſober and temperate a perſon, who is willing, and profeſſing it his advantage, to be of the opinion he oppoſes, if he could, declaring to me that he is not ſatisfied with what I have written, I cannot but in ingenuity be ready to have the leſſe thoughts my ſelf of the ſame, and adviſe my Readers to be the more cautious in receiving it: Nevertheleſſe, ſo long as I find a kind of requiting temper in my breaſt (to my coſt) apt to entertain the hardeſt prejudice, my own heart, or others, or the tempter can ſuggeſt againſt my ſelf in this thing, which is followed many times with dark and dread reflexions, and yet when I conſult with my judgement alone, (which I ought) and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61796:9"/>follow the little unclouded reaſon that I have at any time to uſe about it, it appears to me, that both what this author ſayes may be fully anſwered, and what I have, is for the main not touched, or in the weight not impaired, I can but be ſorry my ability hath been no more to ſerve thoſe I have deſired, and be content, ſuch as I have, to lay out yet once more in their behalf, and my own; though I muſt needs ſay, with ſuch a heavie and weakned ſpirit in good earneſt, that I have more need to crave their prayers unto God and be ſupported my ſelf, then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer freſh ſupport and furtherſatisfaction to others. <hi>He giveth power to the ſaint, and to them that have no might he encreaſeth ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A hard task it is upon me, unto him I look up; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well tell from whence to derive my diſcourſe, which is ſure to meet with ſo much prejudicate intereſt, and opinion. It is Cuſtom I know and the common apprehenſion that rules <hi>the many,</hi> and while their heads run ſhallow, it is not enough for a man to embark in a ſound bottom, unleſſe we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the tide alſo, and ſtream with us. I remember what a ſtrange thing the <hi>Antipodes</hi> ſeem to <hi>Lactantius,</hi> as others of the Fathers; and to beleeve any habitable land beyond the Ocean, was to the antient <hi>Clemens another world,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> It is enough certainly to make truth it ſelf ſeem a crime if it appears but ſingular, and if <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, but offers to bring <hi>ſome new thing,</hi> they will determin it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to be <hi>babbling;</hi> though it was the ſpread doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion. And yet is not this all, but there are the ſeveral engagements of mens ſpirits, and concernments to bee met with alſo, wherein, one muſt look to run the fate of ſuch who are engaged in arbitrations, who when they have moſt carefully diſcharged their truſt, doe reap but ill will on both ſides; and only have left them the teſtimony of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that though both parties (that are extream) be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, yet both have cauſe to be content. <hi>Hee perſued, and poſſed ſafely, even by the way, that he had not gone, with his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a School adage well applyed to the Intellect, <hi>Intus exiſtens prohibet alienum;</hi> and I perceive indeed here that the common notion which lies upprrmoſt, hath ſo filled the minds of moſt, that Orders makes us Miniſters, (which ſhould bee rightly underſtood) and that we are Miniſters already, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61796:9"/>they have no thoughts hardly left them <hi>free born</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of this matter. It is beſides the Original humour of man, to be apt <hi>to think of himſelf more high then he ought to think</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>and not ſoberly, according to the meaſure God hath dealt him;</hi> and hereupon is the Ordainer ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that in Orders he conferrs no leſſe then the holy Ghoſt it ſelf, his grace or gifts, or the ſpiritual power at leaſt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, which all are indeed the prerogative (I take it) alone of Jeſus Chriſt; and does argue, both the pride of ſome mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings that dare aſſume ſo much without Gods word, and the lowneſſe of others, to take it up upon truſt, as if our Proteſtants all, as well as the Papiſts were of that opinion. A large preſumption, that lying at the bottom of this diſpute, does require ſome of our firſt and moſt ſerious thoughts about it, as introductory to our buſineſſe. <hi>I ſaid, I will anſwer alſo my part, I alſo will ſhew my opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To fetch this matter from the beginning; Let us look unto the Prieſts under the Law, and obſerve what God almighty hath ſaid in the firſt place. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.9. <hi>The priests office ſhall be Aarons and his ſonnes, for a perpetual ſtatute.</hi> I gather from hence, that the Right, power, dignity, office of Prieſthood, did flow immediately upon the prieſts under the law from this ſtatute, which is undoubtedly <hi>Gods will</hi> appointing of it. If the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power or authority of the prieſt (as our Book of Orders calls us) came only by ſuch a delegation, that conveighes the ſame through mans hands, then was the prieſts under the law no prieſts, or had no power, for they were not ordained prieſts, but <hi>born</hi> prieſts; and this right and power of prieſthood was theirs, we ſee expreſly, <hi>by this ſtatute for ever.</hi> We read indeed of the prieſts ſanctifying themſelves often to ſome particular work, as to carry the Ark, to cleanſe the Sanctuary, and the like, but we read not that they were to be conſecrate to their office, as I yet finde. We read indeed that the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> as he ſucceeded, was to be conſecrate, and annointed, and ſo <hi>Aarons</hi> garments were kept on purpoſe, but foraſmuch as this dignity it ſelf of the high prieſthood, came alſo by birth, it is apparent, that their annointing and conſecration did not give them their right and office, but only ſolemnize and confirm it; as princes who are ſo by birth cannot have the regal office conveighed, but declared and ratified by their inauguration. As for the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61796:10"/>reſt of the prieſts, we read of one conſecration only by <hi>Moſes</hi> at once for all of them. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. And certainly we may conceive if God did intend that the Miniſterial power ſhould be conveighed ordinarily through the hands of man any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as the ſignifiers of his will, then ſhould not one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration (it is like) have ſufficed for all, but he would have commanded every one of them to be particularly conſecrate, or ſet apart for the receiving that power by man in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Beſides when <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes are conſecrate at once by <hi>Moſes,</hi> this is all you ſhall find in it. <hi>An Investiture</hi> by ſeveral ceremonies (you may ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.) which all are manifeſtly (without the leaſt word or form of conferring power) by the way onely of external ſolemnization; and <hi>an Attonement</hi> made by ſacrafice for them, becauſe elſe they might not approach the holy God in their fins; and therefore, is is ſaid, <hi>This ſhalt thou do to hallow them to miniſter in their office,</hi> Exod. 29.1. It is not ſaid, This thou ſhalt do to give them their office Their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was conferred by Gods appointment, and the hallowing them is only to the work, that they might ſtand before the Lord to execute their ſervice in the holy place.</p>
            <p>And now let us come to look alſo under the Goſpel; <hi>All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>is given me in heaven and earth, Go, preach, and baptize.</hi> Here we ſee from whence the authority of the Miniſtry is derived, and that is from him only who is the Maſter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and fountain of power. And does he ſay this to his Apoſtles only? No: it followes, <hi>And lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.</hi> Again, when he aſcended and gave gifts to men, as he gave ſome to be apoſtles, ſo <hi>he gave ſome to be paſtors and teachers,</hi> Eph. 4 It is he then gives the office; <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us in the Miniſtry,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.38. It is the father <hi>ſends forth labourers into the harveſt;</hi> and though thoſe Elders (it is likely) at <hi>Epheſus</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.) were ordained, yet as for their <hi>power,</hi> it is expreſſe <hi>the holy Ghost made them Overſeers.</hi> We receive our commiſſion and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from them whoſe embaſſadors we are, but we are not the embaſſadors of men, but the <hi>Stewards of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. and <hi>embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>VVho then is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Steward, whom his Lord ſhall make ruler of his houſhold,</hi> Luke 12.42. It is the will (I gather) and appointment of the Lord which gives the formal being of a ruler to this ſteward, and at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61796:10"/>for the ſervants they might indeed deliver him the keyes, and ſo bee ſaid if you will to make him ſteward (which is to be known alſo) by the way of inveſtiture and external poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>London</hi> Divines, who are to be much regarded in ſuch works of theirs, In <hi>Jus. Div. Min. Evan c.</hi> 11. after they have told us that <hi>the contrary is maintained by many Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> (which by the way, may daſh ſome, who think this Opinion of mine to be ſingular) and are laying down argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that Orders do <hi>give the Ministerial Office</hi> (which arguments I ſhaal anſwer in due place) they check themſelves in their courſe, and tell us, they mean it only as to the <hi>eſſence of the outward call;</hi> and if that indeed be all, let us take their meaning thus, that it gives the Office <hi>before men,</hi> ſo that a man is (and is to be) taken for a Miniſter thereupon, which in the Court of the Church he was not before, and that does hit the truth (I think) and bottom of this matter. I do not doubt but we may ſay (as we do ordinarily) that Ordination makes us Miniſters, nay that it makes us ſo, as we were not before; but then we muſt underſtand this aright; There is therefore this diſtinction (which is clear in its own light) to be received here, unleſs we will remain ſtill in the dark; and that is this, The Miniſterial power which a man hath, by vertue of that grand warrant, <hi>Go and Teach all Nations,</hi> muſt be conſidered as good, <hi>In foro Dei,</hi> or <hi>In foro Eccleſiae.</hi> There are many worthy Perſons who devoting themſelves to this ſervice, have preached a good ſpace (as <hi>Origen</hi> of old) before they have taken orders, (when perhaps they have forborn the Sacraments) and we may not doubt but ſome of them have converted ſouls; Now where there is converſion, there is Faith, and where there is that preaching as begets Faith, the Preacher muſt be ſent; which is expreſſe <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.15. and conſequently ſuch a man then muſt have his Commiſſion in the Court of God, when he hath none yet in the court of man, and is not a Miniſter yet indeed as to the Church, before Orders. Ordination then does make a man a Miniſter, as Baptiſm makes a Chriſtian, when he hath ſaving grace before. The Orders of the Church does give the Miniſtry, as the abſolution of the Church does forgive ſinnes; that is, where a man hath true faith and repentance, and ſo is forgiven in heaven. It is the prerogative of God to forgive ſinnes, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61796:11"/>yet doeth the Church forgive them in her court, that is, <hi>declares and pronounces to the penitent remiſſion,</hi> as our Liturgy hath it. It is the prerogative royal of Jeſus Chriſt to appoint his own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in his Church, and yet does the Church make a man a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in her court, that is, <hi>declares, pronounces</hi> him to be ſuch, approves and confirms his call from the Lord by this ſolemnity. <hi>There is no man taketh to himſelf this honour, but he that is called of God,</hi> Heb. 5. This calling then of God is that which gives the honour and office in his ſight, and the call of man (whereof Orders is the conſummation) does give it him <hi>before men,</hi> by ſolemnization. If it muſt be firſt given of God before a man may take it to himſelf, I gather <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it muſt be firſt given of God before another can apply it to him by the ceremonie thereof. <hi>And Abraham received circumciſion, a ſigne of the righteouſneſſe of faith which he had whiles he was uncircumciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the outward call thoſe Divines ſpeak of, it muſt bee oppoſed to the inward; The inward call is this call of God as diſtinguiſhed from mans. Herein I have conceived three things.
<list>
                  <item>1. The Inſtitution, which is Gods appointing ſuch an office to bee, and that thoſe who have ſuch gifts ſhall bee ſuch officers.</item>
                  <item>2. The Gift, which is Gods endownents of a perſon adapting him for this office, and that <hi>peculiarly</hi> above others; which I put in, becauſe the abilities of a perſon are warily to bee conſidered, according to mens ſeverall capacities, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, condition, and thoſe circumſtances of providence, and otherwiſe, which render ſeveral men of the ſame parts, ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their generation, under ſeveral employments.</item>
                  <item>3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is the reſigning a mans ſelf hereunto, and does lye in thoſe holy and ſincere deſires and ends, that the ſpirit of God alone can ſtirre up, and a man ought to have, that does devote his life to ſo ſacred a function, to wit, that his great aim in the prevailing Intereſt of his heart be nothing elſe but the glory of his Redeemer and Salvation of mens ſouls.</item>
               </list>
When God now hath given the ſecond of theſe to wit the gift; the firſt alone does neceſſarily conveigh to him the Power, and makes the third his duty. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every one of us is given Grace according to the meaſure of the Gifts of Chriſt. Eph.</hi> 4.7. By grace is meant there (I ſuppoſe) Authority or Office (as we ſhall ſee more ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and then it followes, where there are Chriſts gifts this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61796:11"/>Authority to uſe them is given with them. So 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>The Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall.</hi> The Gifts alone do infer a power to edifie the Church by them. Hence in that place before <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. if we compare <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. with <hi>v.</hi> 11. while Chriſt is giving gifts in the one, he gives the office in the other; And the reaſon is good, becauſe the power does ſlow upon the gifts, from the Inſtitution. A power let me ſay again, but <hi>in Gods ſight;</hi> for it is not for every man to pretend gifts and ſtraight be a Miniſter, which I ſhall meet with well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if you will attend a little till its due place. When the Lord in the parable gave the man his talent, that alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd him and obliged him to traffique with it. There was no need more in a Prophet then to be inſpired with a Prophecy to be ſent of the Lord. No more can there be likewiſe required in a Miniſter to give him his Office <hi>before God,</hi> then this call of God. And as for the farther <hi>call of man,</hi> which is yet required to a Miniſter <hi>before men,</hi> that was not to a prophet, when there are already the three things mentioned, what can there be more herein diſtinguiſhed there from (beſides the commending a man to Gods grace, or the invocation of his bleſſing upon him for his work, which is the moſt ſignal end of this Rite. <hi>Act.</hi> 14) then I and our Proteſtant Divines do account of it. <hi>viz.</hi> Such a Perſon preſents himſelf to the Ordainers, they examine him, and what is it they are to ſearch and to find? Why if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is, it is this, whether the man hath the gift, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they may conclude that he is commiſſioned according to Chriſts Inſtitution, and alſo hath ſincere ends of being faithfull in his place; if they find this, here is the <hi>call of God,</hi> and what is there remaining poſſible for them to do beſides what is done, but to confirm it before men, that they may receive him? So that this Rite in its eſſence (to uſe thoſe Divines word) is but the ſolemn Approbation, Declaration, or Confirmation of our call by God; and the immediate effect of it, is the value, repute, outward Authority, Account, or Eſteem with men as Miniſters of his, to all ends and purpoſes in the Church, and place where a man ſhall be ſo appointed. And this is that thing which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders does really and effectually give, which is not a matter neither of ſmall moment, but of great conſequence, even ſo much as the free paſſage of the Goſpel comes to in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61796:12"/>Church where we are; which muſt therefore, and will keep up the head of Orders while the World laſts. Now Sirs! The immediate effect of an action muſt be the end of the Agent, and foraſmuch, as in this Change of times and Government which God hath brought upon us, this end and effect, doth fail us in our firſt Orders, we ſee how there ariſes upon a man even from Providence it ſelf, without any other arguing, the neceſſity, the duty (ſuppoſing him at firſt, and ſtill fit) and reaſon of his Re-ordination. And this I take it is the marrow of what I have in my firſt ſheets, which is not yet ſo much as taſted or touched, by my Oppoſer, neither in his Book where he diſputes upon this queſtion, nor in his Appendix, which he hath againſt mee in the way of animadverſion. I ſhall take both now into conſideration, <hi>I will ſpeak, that I may be refreſhed, I will open my lips and anſwer.</hi>

               <p>THere are two things in generall any one may ſee, upon which the ſtreſſe of what this Adverſary hath, doth lye.

I know it ſtands the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon, to ſpeak higher then thus. <hi>Ordo eſt ſacrum quoddam quo ſpiritualis poteſtas traditur ordinato &amp; officium,</hi> ſayes the Maſter of their Schools, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 24. and 'tis no wonder if his Scholars that follow, turn this into <hi>Sacramentum quo character indelebilis in anima im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primitur:</hi> I ſee alſo ſome of the eminent Sons of our own Church, for her <hi>forme</hi> ſake, derived from thence, cannot leave the like conceptions. But I ſuppoſe if our forreign Proteſtant Divines be generally lookt over, we ſhall find that definition, <hi>Ordinatio est vocationis confirmatio,</hi> moſt current; which Dr. <hi>Baldwin</hi> hath taken up as common with them, in his Caſes. When <hi>Calvin,</hi> and our Divines that follow him, ſpeak of the Sacraments as Symbolls of grace, they underſtand it not as ſigns conferring grace, but as ſigns of grace conferred, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11. and define them <hi>the confirmations of our grace.</hi> Now what they take from the Sacraments, they are not like to give to Orders. <hi>Ordo</hi> (ſayes <hi>Bullinger</hi> in his Decads) <hi>eſt Symbolum delegati muneris:</hi> The Symboll of Gods grace, ſayes <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inſtitutes. There muſt be this grace or gift then, this <hi>munus delegatum,</hi> (to wit <hi>a deo</hi>) before, or the Rite cannot (according to their Doctrine) be the Symboll of it; and this is ſo, for a man is tryed, and the <hi>Miniſterial grace</hi> found in him, and then does the Church uſe this Rite as a ſign, token, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boll, by way of teſtimony, or ratification of it. <hi>Vocatio debet habere publicum eccleſiae teſtimonium, &amp; ritus ordinationis nibil ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud eſt quam talis publica teſtificatio,</hi> ſayes <hi>Chemnitius.</hi> De Eccleſ. <hi>Electioni ſaepe addi ſolet publica quaedam per preces &amp; manuum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem inauguratio, &amp; velut in ipſius muneris administrationem miſsio, quae confirmatio dici ſolet.</hi> Arminius Diſp. priv. theſ. 59. <hi>Ordinandi poteſtas ſeu in miniſterio confirmandi</hi> The <hi>Leyden</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. <hi>Praeſentatio &amp; confirmatio.</hi> Muſculus. <hi>Miniſtrorum appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio.</hi> Eraſmus Sarcerius. <hi>Conſecratio &amp; in muneris poſſeſsionem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsio.</hi> Wendiline. <hi>Perſonae examinatae ad functionem obcundam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductio &amp; confirmatio</hi> Polanus (Syntag. l. 7. c. 10.)

               <p>There is one proof which I will note, inſtead of many; It is known that the common thoughts of the learned, whether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern upon <hi>Acts</hi> 13. are that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were there <hi>ordained to their apoſtleſhip:</hi> ſo <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> ſo Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the place. Now <hi>Pauls</hi> apoſtleſhip was certainly given him immediately by Chriſt, Ordination then (if this be ordination
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61796:13"/>according to the full ſtream) is not, muſt not, cannot be this Collation of the power it ſelf, but this teſtification before the Church, whereof we are ſpeaking, or a confirmation. <hi>Melius eſt</hi> (ſayes that learned Profeſſor of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> at firſt mentioned) <hi>vocare ordinationem ſolennem ritum quo teſtificatur de legitima vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione doniſque neceſſariis.</hi> In the Harmony of Confeſſions, <hi>It is taught that ſuch be choſen who have gifts, and are of a Hameleſs life &amp;c. above all that they be proved whether they be ſuch, and ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prayers and faſtings being made, they may be confirmed or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Elders by the laying on of hands.</hi> The Bohemian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. So the Helvetian yet more full, but I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cite that more to my need ſomewhere hereafter, <hi>Manus impoſitiones verba ſunt myſtica quibus</hi> confirmatur <hi>ad opus Electus,</hi> ſayes St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon 1 Tim 4. and thus is it called <hi>Oratio &amp; benedictio</hi> among the antients. If I were near ſome good Library I might perhaps turn over a ſcore of Common places and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends of Proteſtant Divinity to prove this further; but I doe ſee half a dozen more before my eyes, and brought to my hands without labour; <hi>Hunnius, Ameſius, Crocius, Junius, Tarnovius, Voetius,</hi> Lutherans and Calviniſts, who expreſs Ordination ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Declaratio ſolennis, Conſtitutionis testificatio, miſsio ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennis in poſſeſsionem, manifeſtatio, promulgatio coram Eccleſiae,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Seaman</hi> hath them in his book of Ordination, and tells us <hi>They are to be understood of the rite of Ordination,</hi> to wit, as I intend it, diſtinguiſht from election, <hi>and in that ſenſe may be admitted,</hi> and ſo is it rightly compared (he acknowledges) by our Proteſtants to <hi>Coronation,</hi> p. 16. Now then, as there may be reaſon of State ſometimes for a double inauguration of the Magiſtrate; So may there be (if I may ſo ſpeak) reaſon of Church, for re-ordination of the Miniſter; and ſo long as both agree in their nature, the one may be (I ſuppoſe) a good argument for the other. There is a learned but too vehement adverſary I ſee upon this ſubject, that does mention <hi>Olivers</hi> double inveſtiture, before a Lord Mayor, and before a parliament, as Protector; but he might have made mention of other examples, that would have reliſhed better. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> of old did feel of what advantage it was againſt them to the affairs of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th was crowned more then once. Yet will not I reſt here; for we have ſacred inſtances in Scripture even of the moſt famous of all the Kings of the Jewes, who were annointed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61796:13"/>from the Lord by the hand of Prophets and Prieſts, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated again after before the face of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if what the forequoted judicious Doctor intimates to us (pag. 15.) bee good, that annointing to Kings amongſt the Jewes was <hi>in ſome ſenſe eſsential to their calling,</hi> this one compariſon alone, I judge, muſt needs ſtrike a great ſtroak to the determining this matter.</p>
               <p>It is true that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and Schoolmen and ſome Antients, who make Orders to be a Sacrament, and a means of conferring the Holy Ghoſt, may look on it, as injurious to the Rite it ſelf (as doth appear by a ſentence of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> this Author quotes) to repeat the ſame; but our Proteſtants, and eſpecially the more learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> of them (who tell us that this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands was doubtleſſe taken up from the cuſtome of the Jews (ſome add in their Synagogues) in ordaining their Elders, and not from the ſacred mouth and command of Chriſt as Baptiſme was) are not and need not be ſo ſtrait laced in this matter. It is true alſo, that ſome of our own grave Divines are willing to put as high an honour as they can on this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; Mr. <hi>Hocker</hi> who ſtrives to do ſo, <hi>Ec. Pol. p.</hi> 410, 411, 412, 413. hath theſe words. <hi>What Angel in Heaven could have ſaid to man as our Lord did to Peter, Feed my ſheep, Preach, Baptize, Do this, whoſoever ſins you retain are retained? O wretched blindneſſe if we admire not ſo great power; more, if we conſider it aright, and notwithſtanding imagine any but God can bestow it!</hi> The learned <hi>Grotius De Imp. Sum.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61796:14"/>gives Paſtors and Teachers; the Holy Ghost makes Overſeers. It may be objected that the Church hath Authority to call and ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.

There is five Diſputations about Church Government of Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> the ſecond whereof, as ſoon as the Book came to my hand, did put me methinks out of countenance, to ſee when I had been beating long about ſomething, with what fullneſſe and perſpicuity h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hath gone before me. Let me ſet down a few paſſages. <hi>The Ordainers</hi> (p. 146.) <hi>do not give the power, as from themſelves to others, nor doth it paſſe through their hands. It is the ſtanding act of Chriſt in his Law that giveth the power immediately.</hi> The ordinary judgement I think of Divines is, that the Miniſterial Authority is from Chriſt, but <hi>mediately,</hi> But this acute and known Divine ſayes <hi>immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tely:</hi> He explains it p. 147. <hi>As in the making of Bayliffs for our Corporations, either the people, or the Burgeſſes have the power of chooſing, and the Steward or Recorder of ſwearing him, and performing the Ceremonies; and yet none of theſe conferre the power, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the Prince alone, by the Charter of the Cities or Towns, as his Inſtrument. So is it in the Ordaining of Miniſters: The People may chooſe, and the Paſtors may inveſt, but it is God only by the Goſpell Charter that conferrs the power from himſelf.</hi> You will ſay, though we have a Charter, a man is not a Magiſtrate till choſen, nor compleated till ſworn, therefore it is mediately. I anſwer, true, it is mediately, or through the means of the people and Steward doing that which is their part, which is only deſigning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not mediately through them as deriving the power, (which they have not themſelves) that is, if you will, it is through them, putting the condition according to the Charter, for the Charter requires this, that a man be choſen, and ſworn,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61796:14"/>but the condition being put, the power flowes immediately from the charter itſelf: Why ſo here; <hi>The power is immediately</hi> (ſayes he, p. 234.) <hi>from Chriſt, and men do but open the door, or determine of the perſon that ſhall from Chriſt receive the power, and then put him ſolemnly into poſſeſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is what is clear and well, but there is a little more needfull to make it full. Although in this buſineſſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate which is Civil, where the authority is of man, and the officers, officers of men, it is enough to look no further then men, and an outward court onely; yet in the buſineſſe of the Miniſtry, where the authority is ſpiritual, and the officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the officers immediately of Jeſus Chriſt and not of man, we are to look further unto God and his inward court al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and account that a man hath, and muſt have, his authority firſt <hi>in his ſight,</hi> before he hath it in mans, and conſequently what is done in mans court is by the way of Miniſtry ſignifying his will, for the declaration or confirmation thereof <hi>with us;</hi> to wit, The right, faculty, authority, or commiſſion which a man hath <hi>coram Deo</hi> and the court of his own conſcience, as being truly called of God, is allowed or approved by this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick teſtimony of the Church, ſo that he is received, reckoned, or numbred (as it is ſaid of <hi>Matthias</hi>) amongſt the Miniſters of Chriſt, which is the very direct and proper effect of this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act of inveſtiture and ſolemnization.</p>
               <p>I will take an eminent paſſage from Mr <hi>Hooker,</hi> who muſt be forced to underſtand here with us. <hi>The cauſe why we breath not as Chriſt did on them unto whom he imparted power, is for that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit nor ſpiritual authority may be thought to proceed from us, which are but delegates or aſsigns to give men poſſeſsion of his graces,</hi> Ec. Pol. p. 431. And here then, I ſhall humbly call in my Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal fathers and brethren, who have been apt to wonder at me in my firſt ſheets, that I ſhould hold that Orders does not give the Miniſterial power, when they may rather wonder at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they ſhould think it, wheras ſuch a perſon as this, who was as like as any (by the reſt of his diſcourſe) to maintain it if he durſt does diſclaim it, as the doctrine of the Papiſts, by their practiſe (who do breath on the perſon whom they ordain, as Chriſt did) and not as the belief of our Church. And as for the delegation and aſſignment he ſpeaks of, his meaning is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe enough, to be no other then as when a Lord does give
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61796:15"/>or grant an eſtate to a perſon, he ſends his ſervant to uſe thoſe Ceremonies, which are to ſignifie that grant of his, by way of delivery, upon which he is received as the owner and poſſeſſor thereof. I will expreſſe it fully for him with a concluding paſſage from the aforeſaid bright author. <hi>Ordination is one means conjunct with others for deſignation of right qualified perſons deſcribed in the Law of Christ for the reception and exerciſe of the Miniſterial office, and the ends of it</hi> (beſides taking care the office fail not) <hi>are, To judge in all ordinary caſes of the fitneſs of perſons; and, To ſolemnize their admittance, by ſuch an inveſtiture, as when poſſeſsion of a houſe, is given by a miniſterial delivery of a key, or of land by a turf; or as a ſouldier is liſted, a King crowned, Marriage ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized after conſent and title, in order to a more ſolemn obligation and plenary poſſeſsion. Such is Ordination.</hi> Mr. Baxter p. 149. When the King ſends over a Lord Lieutenant into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he hath a power by vertue of that high dignity, of making a Knight; now while he uſes the Ceremonies of dubbing, he uſes them not as the ſignification of his Princes will, but of his own; He acts not here as an <hi>Aſsigne,</hi> but does it as an act of his own grace. We are not to conceive that God hath given ſuch a power to the dignity of a biſhop, that he may ſo make Miniſters; No, no, their authority (as the ſolid and learned Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> before) is but a Miniſtry, wherein therefore, they muſt act from God onely as the approvers, ſignifiers, or publiſhers, of his will, (and all thoſe ceremonyes they uſe, are the ſame externall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof) that ſuch a one upon their examination is conſtituted by him according to his word and Charter, to be one of his Miniſters, and that the Church is to receive him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Now then there muſt be this <hi>will</hi> firſt, before the ſignification of it, and the <hi>will</hi> creates the power immediately. The giving the power is one thing, with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> moſt right, and the external inveſtiture or delivery is another. But you will ſay, When an Eſtate or office is given by a perſon, and the delivery made alſo, how can this be done againe? I anſwer, the office cannot be again given, but the ſignification that it is given, may be again. The Lords will is one, and the ſame, but the ſignification of it by outward ceremonies, may be various or multiplied. The ceremonies of the ſame conſecration <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.33. are repeated ſeven dayes together. Beſides there is a difference in the point of <hi>Delivery.</hi> There is a delivery of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61796:15"/>in the thing it ſelf; As if I give one a book, and deliver it, and there is a delivery by a ceremony only, as the token of that poſſeſſion: Here now there may ariſe controverſie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a delivery were legal and ſufficient, or the like; and what courſe then can be beſt taken to put all out of doubt, but to have a new delivery which will be without exception. The caſe is ſo with us juſt; There is queſtion whether Presbyters be Ordainers, and it may be queſtion'd haply more to others pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whether in their Orders there was not a defect of ſome words of formall delivery, as <hi>Take thou authority;</hi> and if a quiet man then ſhall take the way to make all ſure, there is no need that he ſhould underſtand by thoſe words of the Biſhop, (and the impoſition of his hands) that he does give him the power and office of a Miniſter, which he hath already, but rather that this is not given at all by mortal men, but only is indeed a a ſecond time <hi>declared</hi> or ſignified before the face of the church as given of God, by theſe external rites of inveſtiture, delivery, or poſſeſſion. I am ſorry to ſee what a thin vail of words only can cloud mans underſtanding. If I ſhould ſay that Orders, is the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn delivery of the Miniſterial authority to a perſon by the Biſhop as a delegate of Jeſus Chriſt, it may be it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and yet when I ſay it is the confirmation of Chriſts call, it is all one, but underſtood with more ſafety; which if it ſhall appear once in its light to my orthodox Adverſary, I ſhall not need to ſay any thing elſe in compariſon, to his ſatisfaction. The whole force of his arguing againſt me in this thing, hee knowes full well, does lye in this ſuppoſal, that Ordination does give the miniſterial power and office, and is to be taken only to that end; Now if the ground does fall from under him here, there is nothing left him hardly to ſtand upon, in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe, let me here humbly lay down a caution: I would not have any offer to think that I and the forementioned author do go about to make light of Orders, as if when a man hath parts, he may ſtreight goe and be a Preacher of his own head. There are none, I know, that hold Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a call, <hi>coram eccleſia;</hi> I am not a man of that complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I am ſo much for a ſolemn allowance of the Church, that I contend it ſhould be twice done, rather then not bee done to purpoſe; God is a God of Order, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61796:16"/>againſt confuſion and intruſion into his Church. I am ready then with that eminent perſon, to account, not only that it is a great ſin to neglect Ordination, where it may be had, and that the Church is to diſown ſuch, and that it is required by Chriſt, and ſo neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti &amp; medii</hi> too <hi>ad ordinem, &amp; bene eſſe:</hi> but I am willing to go ſo far, that he requires it in his Charter to every <hi>Church</hi> which is <hi>conſtituted,</hi> as a part of the condition, which untill it be put, the Authority <hi>coram hominibus</hi> is ſuſpended. And yet ſo long as being put, it operates only to the power as a condition, doing but its own part; this hinders not but the ſame may be put, and put again, ſo long as it is not <hi>omni modo,</hi> to the ſame effect; and the nature thereof, or part it does, will bear it. What is that you will ſay? and In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard poſſible can the effect be any other, and not altogether the ſame? An Anſwer to theſe two Queſtions will unlooſe the knot here of Re-ordination.</p>
               <p>For the former: There are three things goes to a Miniſter.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The teſtimony of their Conſcience, of their ſincere deſire, not of lucre or honour, but to edifie the Church.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>A faculty to do that to which they have a deſire and will.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Ordination of the Church, which approves and gives teſtimony of their will and ability.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
So Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> in whoſe judgement methinks I rejoyce, to ſee how fully he agrees with me in his Notion of Orders, which yet I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I took not from him, or any other Book, but from its own light in my firſt ſheets. Now whether this teſtification or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Church is ſuch a thing, or no, I leave to this fair Adverſary himſelf to judge; and I hope he will ſee, as thoſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and deſires, the chief part of the condition, Chriſts Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires, may and are to be renewed ſtill, or encreaſed, ſo may the <hi>approbation</hi> of the ſame <hi>(ad bene eſſe)</hi> be renewed alſo, and our Miniſtry be the better, not as all the worſe for it.</p>
               <p>For the latter: When I allow thus much to Orders to be a condition, that is <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> of our Office-power, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it (you muſt note it well) to be ſo truly, and only <hi>in the Court of the Church.</hi> A condition is ſuch a thing you may ſay, as cannot be repeated, for it being put, the effect follows, and when the effect is obtained, the thing can have no longer the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a condition. I anſwer then, The Court of the Church, wherein alone I affirm that Orders is this condition, is varied
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61796:16"/>and doubled, and hence it is, that the condition it ſelf alſo is doubled, and the effect flowing from the ſame varied like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. While the court of the Church was Presbyterian, any Orders if Scriptural onely, was the condition; but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w it is Epiſcopal, no Orders but Canonical alſo is the condition. In both courts then, or either of them, unleſſe a perſon be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he is no Miniſter, and ſo the condition requiſite to our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>coram Eccleſia,</hi> is the ſame in both, to wit Orders; but as theſe Orders which are the condition are diverſified, and Epiſcopal Ordination diſtinguiſhed from Presbyterian, ſo the condition, I hope, is not the ſame: In like manner the effect which flowes from the condition being put, in either or both theſe courts, is this <hi>Church</hi>-authority (as I ſpeak) or the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us as Miniſters in the court of the Church, and ſo is the ſame, but as theſe courts wherein we are ſo received (and are the <hi>termini relationis</hi>) are varied and not the ſame, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the effect alſo muſt be diverſified or multiplyed, and ſo not the ſame, though the ſame; which ends the difficulty.</p>
               <p>Having laid this caution, there followes an Objection, which as to the main, hath ſometimes been a ſtop upon my mind. I doe conceive that the Ordainers do act from God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the approving or declaring a mans Miniſtry more then once, drawes happily the ampler reception, and no abſurdity in it: but I may be miſtaken perhaps, and the Ordainers act from the Church or people to God, in preſenting him a ſervant from amongſt them to his houſe; Even as when the Levites were ſeparate to God, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. it is ſaid, <hi>Aaron ſhall offer them before the Lord for an offering of the children of Iſrael,</hi> v. 11. And hence are the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> themſelves to lay their hands upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 10. whereby there might be ſignified happily their parting with their right in them, which to do again were a kind of owning their right ſtill, and look like ſacraledge in it. But this conceit I gueſſe is ſome of that cloſe ſuperſtition which is ſtill apt to exerciſe my thoughts in this matter. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that when God ſaved the firſt-born of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he challenged them to himſelf; the firſt-born of the cattel were to be offer'd in ſacrafice to him, and for the firſt-born of their Sons he accepts the Levites; and hence it is they were the <hi>offering of the people,</hi> and that they laid their hands on them in offering them, becauſe (I ſay) it was in lieu of their firſt-born,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61796:17"/>which is all plain in the Text: <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18. Now as for us under the Goſpel, when Jeſus Chriſt the only true firſt-both is offered, there is up ſuch propriety and diſcrimination, and conſequently no offering of the Miniſtry in lieu thereof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though the Levites, whoſe office was but a ſervice only, (to help <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.) were <hi>an offering of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> the Prieſts, which was not a bare Service, but a Dignity, were no offering of the people, but taken by God into that honour and office of himſelf. The Subjects of a Prince may preſent him with ſlaves to do his work, but they preſent him not with Embaſſadors (as we are) to be entruſted with the affairs of his Kingdom. It may be yet ſaid, it is true, he that hath <hi>this honour,</hi> muſt have <hi>Gods calling,</hi> and conſequently the Ordainers act from God in ordaining him; but there may be a middle way, to wit, that they act not from God to the Church or people, nor from the Church to God, but from God to God, and ſo their whole act be terminated in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying or ſeparating a perſon to him, without reference at all otherwiſe, to the Church or people. As for this, though the thing be conſpicuous in its own nature and ſolemnity, let us ſuppoſe (untill it appears farther) it were ſo, and then muſt we take into conſideration what this ſeparating or ſanctifying a man unto God is. Under the Law it is plain there were ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices appointed, and by theſe the Prieſts and Levites were clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they might draw nigh to God; Under the Goſpel there is no Sacrafice, but only there are Prayers, and conſequently the commending a man to the grace of God for his work by Prayer, is all that ſanctification there can be in this matter; and as for the impoſition of Hands it ſelf, it is nothing but the expreſſe <hi>deſignation</hi> of the perſon upon whoſe head we crave the diſcention of his bleſſing. To which purpoſe <hi>Calvin</hi> in his inſtitutions tell us, that this rite was taken from <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing his Grand-children, which was by Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.15, 16. And <hi>Grotius</hi> is quoted by Mr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> ſpeaking about the <hi>Jews</hi> ordaining their Elders, <hi>Epi. ad Gal.

               <p>In a form of Church policy preſented in a Convention at <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> anno 1560. I read in <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> p. 156. <hi>Other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies then the publick approbation of the people, and the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chief Miniſter, that the perſon there preſented is appointed to ſerve that Church, we cannot approve, for albeit the Apoſtles uſed impoſition of hands, yet ſeeing the miracle is ceaſed, the uſing the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony we judge not to be neceſſary.</hi> In another, anno 1578. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Parliament. <hi>Ordination is the ſeparation and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the perſon appointed by God and the Church, after he is well tryed, and found qualified. The ceremonies are Fasting, Prayer, and Impoſition of hands of the Elderſhip,</hi> p. 292. This notion of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is that I ſuppoſe is like to paſſe with the Presbyterian, and perhaps one may think though a double approbation or declaration draws in it no abſurdity, yet a Conſecration of a thing or perſon to the Lord more then once, may ſeem hainous. Let us know therefore, that there is really no more in the thing under this conception, then under the other. This Learned man my Adverſary himſelf, does well quote <hi>Maſon</hi> and another, who holding with him, that the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbyter is the ſame, differing only <hi>gradu,</hi> not <hi>ordine;</hi> anſwer their new inveſtiture with this, that our Church calls it not an Ordering, but Conſecration, ſo that a double Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration in the ſame Office, is not to be accounted belike any matter, they themſelves being judges. The Temple under the Law we find new conſecrated by <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> The Prieſts at the ſame time do new conſecrate themſelves, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30, 34. In the Goſpel too we read again of <hi>Feſtum Encaeniorum, Jo.</hi> 10.22. But there is one inſtance alone does ſatisfie me in this thing beyond exception, and that is of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom we read not only to be annointed, which is conſecrated, but it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>to the Lord</hi> (that makes it ſacred) <hi>a ſecond time.</hi> If there was any native evil or abſurdity in the thing it ſelf, to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61796:18"/>have a double conſecration or inveſtiture unto the ſame Office or work, how comes this to paſſe, that holy <hi>David,</hi> and his moſt wiſe Son, with the Fathers and Elders of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould make no ſcruple at all at it? There is this one Text much wanting therefore in my former ſheets, which I now offer fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my caſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.22. where I note three things.
<list>
                     <item>1. That Ordination makes a man a Miniſter, (I count) as they are ſaid in the words <hi>to make Solomon King.</hi> We none deny but Orders make a Miniſter, only let it be underſtood from hence, <hi>Perfectivè,</hi> Complementally, by way of Declaration, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization.</item>
                     <item>2. That a double inveſtiture or conſecration to the ſame Office, is expreſly exemplified in Scripture (for which I quote this place) and why it ſhould be more to be <hi>Re-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> then <hi>Re-annointed,</hi> no Proteſtant I believe can tell. So that where I have compared <hi>Ordaining</hi> in my Book ſtill to a double Marrying, I wiſh I had rather put in <hi>Annointing,</hi> to make the ſimile the more ſure.</item>
                     <item>3 That it is probable what Mr. <hi>Roſſe</hi> (Panſ. p. 8.) tell us, that this <hi>Zadock</hi> was High-prieſt at the end of <hi>Sauls</hi> reign, but <hi>David</hi> favouring <hi>Abiathar,</hi> preferred him, and retained them both, and conſequently that he was annointed the ſecond time Prieſt, as <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſecond time King. So I cloſe my firſt generall. <hi>And they made Solomon King the ſecond time, and annointed him to the Lord to be chief Governour, and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock to be Prieſt.</hi>

               <p>FOr the ſecond generall: The <hi>Form</hi> which the Biſhop uſes, I will confeſſe it freely, to be ſo compiled to the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Orders, as is moſt proper for ſuch as are made <hi>ex non Ministris Miniſtri,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) yet let not my tender Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be troubled at this, ſeeing that hinders not but it may ſerve too, for thoſe that are only <hi>declared</hi> to be <hi>Ministri,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or regularly, legally, canonically made what they were truly in the ſighs of God before; It is the offence of mens minds makes this ſo grievous. There is no Ordination indeed is any more then a Declaration and Allowance before the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61796:18"/>Church of a mans call from God, and let a man read the Forme quite over, one may rather wonder at it, as a happineſſe there is no more incongruity to our caſe, then complain there is ſo much, as if it were compiled with ſome tender regard hereto, that if any were ordained before (as beyond Sea) otherwiſe, they might not ſcruple for all that (if they thought good) to ſubmit to it. The words <hi>Ordered,</hi> and <hi>Admined,</hi> is the worſt this ſober man himſelf can pick out, which when I ſee in the inſtruments of our Orders, as it were purpoſely interpreted for us, <hi>ſecundum ritus Eccleſiae Anglicanae admiſſimus &amp; Legitimè &amp; Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicè ordinavimus,</hi> I cannot but conclude what I have ſaid, and ſay that it is well this form indeed is no worſe, (I mean more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) ſeeing as yet we have no other. And if there ſhall come any future change hereof, I muſt fore note that that can neither be objected or pleaded as to me in the matter.</p>
               <p>In this whole Forme there are theſe things. The Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Prayers; The Ceremonies; The Deaconſhip; The Queſtions and Reſponſes between Biſhop and Miniſter; and after all (though that be beyond my Queſtion) the inſtrument of our Orders.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: There are ſeverall perſons to be Ordained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it may be twenty or thirty, (there was thereabouts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained with me) The Exhortations now and Prayers are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at once indefinitely; and that alone I hope does take away all ſcruple quite in that whole matter; for the caſe is the ſame as in our Sermons and Prayers in the Congregation, which will not I ſuppoſe be refuſed, becauſe ſome one or other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, is not apt and adaequate to the caſe of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall perſon. Nevertheleſſe upon a view of the whole I find not one petition or direction that may not be uſed in our caſe, let it have its grains of allowance and fair interpretation; and as for what this Author ſuggeſts as if we prayed <hi>to be made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> or to receive the Miniſterial power (which we have and are already) he may as well ſay, we are exhorted to be made ſo, and receive the ſame, equally with as much ſenſe and truth in it.

               <p>For the Deaconſhip, I have I think ſpoke enough in my firſt ſheets, p. 92, 93.

Is this a reaſon ſound enough for ſo great a matter, becauſe he will not abaſe himſelf to a lower degree for a moment in the Church, then he is in already? There is certainly no bottom here. This ſober man would not indeed have all his brethren, that are tender herein, to go preſently out of the Vineyard, to accompany him, would he? Suppoſe a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, nay ſuppoſe twenty that do much good in their place, yet being ſenſible of the burden of their calling, and made more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by him, ſhall be glad now of his book and example, and ſo ſatisfie their conſciences, to leave their charge, and give off; will this bring any reall pleaſure and ſolid content to this mans heart, and can he comfortably rejoyce in it before the Lord, to hear of it?

               </p>
               <p>For the fourth Queſtion and Reſponſes. This one thing is plain at the firſt ſight. Here is the part of the Biſhop and the part of the Miniſter, and each one is to look to his own part. For the Miniſter, let him be ſerious and carefull of what he ſayes for himſelf, ſo as to be ſure he does not in the leaſt offend his conſcience; which he ſhall not doe if he purpoſes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perform what he promiſes; if perhaps his ſoul is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der herein, as to ſome paſſages in regard of the pious ſenſe of his frailty, as when the words run ſtrict, <hi>Will you uſe all endeavour</hi> to do thus and thus, and the anſwer is, <hi>I will do ſo;</hi> what if for <hi>I will,</hi> he ſomewhere ſay <hi>I deſire?</hi> More particularly, when the duties of the Deacon are propoſed and he conſiders that upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61796:20"/>his being Prieſt the proper work of that Office, which is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (and which he would not engage unto) does ceaſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plain Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. what if he alter the word <hi>ſo,</hi> and ſay <hi>I will do what concerns me,</hi> (or the like) and ſo likewiſe for other expreſſions. No Biſhop (I hope) will find fault with ſuch a matter. For the Ordainer, let him likewiſe conſider well, that what he ſayes and does be according to his own eſtabliſhed judgement; for this rule, I muſt account equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to both, that neither party are to account themſelves reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to God herein for the parts (words or acts) of the other, but their own. <hi>When I joyn with a man in an action</hi> (ſaith Mr. Burroughes) <hi>I am to look to the action and principle that I go upon, but let him with whom I joyn look to the principle he goes upon. If he will goe on a falſe ground when he may go on a true, let him look to it.</hi> Iren. p. 184.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but be ſorry to hear how it hath fared with ſome in our caſe, they have been loath to tell the Biſhop that they were ordained before, and he hath been loath to know it; but <hi>if they will be ordained, he will ordain them.</hi> This is not fair play: He ſhould enquire whether they were ſo or no, and if they were, let him endeavour to convince them if he can of the nullity of their former Orders, if he cannot, let him hear their reaſon why they ſubmit to be Re-ordained. When this is done, I will ſuppoſe the Biſhop keeps his mind, and ſo tells a man plainly, that for as much as he is his <hi>Ordinary,</hi> who ought not to allow of any to exerciſe the Miniſtry without Orders, and he for his part does believe in his Conſcience, that all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by Presbytery only is null and void, and therefore for the ſatisfaction of him, his Biſhop, and of others, and the preſent Church, he requires this ſame of him. This is plain dealing from him. The Miniſter I will ſuppoſe likewiſe to remain of the ſame mind, and he ſtill declares his former Miniſtry to be valid, yet in regard that he is fully prrſwaded that Re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no where forbidden by Gods word, and our Rulers are to be obeyed in indifferent things, and this conduces more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, or is made neceſſary to the exerciſe of his Miniſtry where he is called, he does upon this account yield to the ſame. This is plain alſo. Here is plain dealing on both ſides: Now it was the ſaying of one very grave Biſhop (which I think fit his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61796:20"/>ſhould know) in the caſe to one after ſome ſuch kind of debate, whom he ſpake to there about, <hi>I will Ordain you in my ſenſe,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and you may be Re-ordained in your own,</hi> (or words to that effect) which I mention and offer even for the moſt clear and honeſt determination of this matter, whereas if either ſide do hide, they can hardly come off with this ſoundneſs of mind, and wholeneſs of conſcience.</p>
               <p>In a Conferrence (as I have heard) between the Presbyterian and preſent Biſhops, it was propoſed for an Accomodation in this caſe, that an Hypothetical forme might be uſed, <hi>Si non ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus ſis, &amp;c.</hi> I perceive my Author (p. 3.) would hardly have been content with this, <hi>If there could be an invincible doubt whether a man were</hi> de facto <hi>ordained or no,</hi> then he could belike approve hereof, and not elſe; but he looks not here half way to the bottom. A man may be ſure he was ordained, and yet be in doubt whether his ordination by Presbytery be valid: But I will ſuppoſe a man aſſured of the one, and fully perſwaded of the other, yet had this Accomodation been good; becauſe this Hypothetical forme, we are to conceive, not directly to regard the Conſcience of the party to be Re-ordained, as in doubt of his former Orders (for then the ſalve would not have reach'd near the ſoar, when there is not one of a hundred doubt of any ſuch thing) but to regard the judgement or opinion of the Presbyterian and Epiſcopalian in generall, and conſequently the judgement of each Biſhop and particular party in the caſe: The one holds Ordination by the Presbytery only, to be null, the other holds it valid; neither ſide are like to be convinced by, or yield to the other, but muſt leave it, who are in the right, to the great Judge: In the mean time, the mutual condeſcention on ſuch a forme by either party, prejudices neither opinion or cauſe, and yet the practiſe of the thing on both i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61796:21"/>have been laying down, to wit, by the Ordainers and Ordained free Declaration of their conſcience (or account upon which they act) one to another.</p>
               <p>I come now to thoſe words in the forme, which are the chief ſoar, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, Take thou Authority.</hi> Theſe words cannot be ſaid to us who have the Miniſterial power and Office already, ſayes my Adverſary, and that indeed is the core that ſlicks in moſt throats.

Our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians accordingly we know have avoided ſuch kind of words in their Ordination, (which are not expreſly mentioned in any antient Author to be uſed for a thouſand years, ſayes one) ſo that this ſcruple if it be any thing, will lye upon others that are ordained but once, as well as us; and our antient Presbyterians (even the moſt rigid of them) themſelves, if ordained in our Church, muſt come to the bar alſo, who did heretofore ſubmit to the ſame. The reſult whereof then muſt be this, that though the Church perhaps might do well, to examine theſe words, whether better expunged or not, yet if ſhe does retain the ſame, her ſons are to look on their part to be but paſſive herein, and leave the juſtification on her ſcore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us take it for moſt juſt and allowable, that theſe words, ſeeing they have been ſo much called in queſtion, be permitted a free interpretation; and as the Biſhop may take his, if we may but have ours, there will be no prejudice at all in them. By the Holy Ghoſt, as Chriſt uſed the words at firſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded is meant clearly, <hi>the promiſe of the Spirit</hi> he had told them of, and what that was is declared fully, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. at the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt. I know it is ſaid, that the manner of delivery <hi>Receive,</hi> does inferre ſomething elſe then that, at preſent conferr'd; but is meerly a handſome gloſſe, which yet ſome anſwer, <hi>ſic datus
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61796:21"/>fuit Apoſtolis ſpiritus hoc loco ut aſperſi duntaxat fuerint, nondum plena ejus virtute imbuti.</hi> This I will ſay, if we may but be ſo bold to think that the Holy Ghoſt is not given by the Biſhop here, as it was given by Chriſt by his Diſciples, then muſt we have the liberty of our own ſence in the thing; and what then, if by the Holy Ghoſt we underſtand nothing elſe but what is moſt genuine to any indifferent perſon; to wit, his more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence for ſupport and aſſiſtance of us in our Miniſtry; who does not ſee the words to be inoffenſibly competible to our caſe as others? <hi>Neque dubitari potest</hi> (ſayes Arch-deacon <hi>Maſon</hi>) <hi>quin ſingulari quodam modo, praeſto illis fuerit ipſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſanctus ad illos dirigendos, ſuſtinendos, aſsiſtendos, juxta Chriſti promiſsionem, Ecce ego vobiſcum ſum uſque ad finem ſeculi.

                  </gap>hat ſenſe of theſe words is which is or hath been moſt currant with our Biſhops and Church themſelves. The holy Ghoſt eſſentially we know is every where, and ſo not to be given; There muſt then I count be neceſſarily here, a Metonomy <hi>efficientis pro effectu.</hi> The effects of the holy Ghoſt are various; The effect they would have, is ſuch as they may hold <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> alwayes, and certainly conferred hereby to make the rite ſignificant to purpoſe. The ordinary effects now for which the Spirit in Scripture is taken, are his graces, or gifts; For his grace, they will not ſay, they do conferr that (I take Grace ſtrictly, for elſe any thing from Gods good will may be called grace;) For Gifts, they are more wiſe too, then to tye them hereto, any more then Grace; There is ſome effect elſe therefore muſt be found out, and that is, <hi>power;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Ghoſt, with them then, is <hi>a power from the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and this power ſpecified by the next words, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes you forgive,</hi> &amp;c. that is a power to forgive ſins. So <hi>Hooker p.</hi> 412. and Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> (thoſe two like famous ſons of our Church) <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſanctus hoc in loco poteſtatem ſpiritualem denotat quâ peccata re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur.</hi> And ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might be added and more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authours. And this I hope will help my adverſary to his full weight, if he can but really underſtand with ſuch, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this ſenſe is not ſtrained and forc'd. To this then I have diſtinguiſhed for the purpoſe, between the part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Miniſter; Theſe words we know are delivered by the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61796:22"/>Biſhop, and as they belong to his part, let them be put upon his account, and he will juſtifie them in this ſenſe. He beleeves our former ordination to be null, and ſo pronounces them to us, as if we had none of this ſpiritual power derived to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as if he did now give it us hereby. And this we may ſuppoſe too he ſpeaks truly according to his very conſcience. Now if there was required any anſwer here again on our parts directly and clearly acknowledging the ſame, this were a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indeed to me invincible; but when there is nothing of this nature to be ſaid by us, but the hearing only given to what he ſayes, and the interpretation left free; Let us make the beſt of it, and lay not upon our ſelves what belongs not to our charge. And here that the faith of the Biſhop may be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened (while it will ſtand us in ſtead) if he can beleeve ſuch a thing indeed as will juſtifie him in his own ſenſe, the uſing theſe words, to wit, that our former Ordination is null, there is one plea I think of more moment for him then that only which is ordinarily urged, and this author hath confuted, (to wit meerly, that it was not done by a Biſhop) and that is this. It is not only the Biſhops, but the Presbyterians (who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Re-ordaining) do hold that the Miniſterial authority is conferred by Orders; Now in our Orders by Presbyters there was no words at all actually to conveigh this power, as theſe in the Epiſcopal Orders (according to them) do; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they being deſtitute of their end, even that my Author alſo himſelf accounts the end, and only end therof, they may if they can, think them null on that account. And I do remember I have noted one or two learned Authors ſomewhere pointing at this as a defect, and telling us that the Jewes in the impoſing their hands on their Elders (from whence the apoſtles, it is thought, took the rite up) did uſe ſome words ſtill, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to expreſs the authority they did conveigh, intimating as if elſe it were ſcarce an ordination.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To follow this, wheras my Oppoſer does not only ſuppoſe, but ſeems to believe, and argue upon it (even altogether) that the Miniſterial power is indeed conveighed hereby, as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops think themſelves; I will ask him, whether he thinks, if theſe words were not uſed, that power which they impart, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without them, Yea, or No? If he thinks No, then muſt his Ordination I ſay by Presbytery be null, where no ſuch words
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61796:22"/>of giving authority was uſed at all, and he be re-ordained upon that ſcore: If he thinks Yea, yet holds as he does that Orders give it, Why ſhould a rite ſo material and ſignificant be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and the defect not be ſupplied by a new ſolemnity, and ſo that at leaſt, in <hi>Gregories</hi> Decretals take place? <hi>In talibus non eſt aliquid iterandum, ſed cautè ſupplendum, quod incautè fuerat praetermiſſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But to ſet us upon our right bottom; when ſome Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Divine, do plead Ordination by Presbyters to be null upon that maxim, <hi>Nemo dat quod in ſe non habet.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers, p. 234. <hi>It is the firſt error of the adverſary to hold, that this power is given by men as firſt having it themſelves.</hi> So p. 147. <hi>This falſly ſuppoſeth that the Ordainers are the givers of power, the maſter error in their frame; Chriſt hath it, and Chriſt giveth it: Men give it not, though ſome of them have it; for they have it only to uſe, not to give.</hi> Let me ſay the ſame here to my preſent adverſary, and I need ſay no more. If the Miniſterial power be given by Orders, then are Orders of neceſſity to the being of the Miniſtry, but that Orders are not of abſolute neceſſity <hi>neceſsitate medii ad eſse mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterii,</hi> it is proved by that author (<hi>cap.</hi> 3.) beyond anſwer, as by <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tius,</hi> and others. The truth is, there is no Proteſtant Divine I know, but grant <hi>in Eccleſiâ constituendâ,</hi> or in a caſe of neceſſity a man may be a Miniſter without Orders; and if there were but one inſtance in the world where a mans miniſtry is valid unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, the power is proved thereby to be immediately from Chriſt, and the <hi>eſſe miniſterii</hi> not to depend upon ordination. I ſhall content my ſelf with one inſtance, and that is of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> of whom we read in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19. that he was ſent forth by the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then is ordained after with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 13 2. Now I demand, was <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or no? If he was not, then is not the Miniſterial power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by, nor the being of the Miniſtry depend upon, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If he was, then have we here plain text and example for Re-ordination.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To underſtand this clearly, and more fully, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touched The Miniſterial power muſt be conſidered (as I have intimated) <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> or <hi>Coram Hominibus;</hi> when a man hath Gods gifts, and a heart to devote them to the uſe of the Church, it is Chriſts will he ſhould be his Miniſter, and as his will makes it his duty, it muſt give him right and power; now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61796:23"/>when the man hath this, it is his will moreover that theſe gifts be approved, and power declared, by the Church, that he may be received as his Miniſter or Embaſſador, by men, and thoſe particularly unto whom he is ſent. This is done by this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, this is one end and proper nature of it; and ſo the authority he had before <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> is made current <hi>Coram Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> and he reputed and paſſed ſtreight by all amongſt the Order (as we call it) of the Clergy. Underſtand me I pray here: The authority of the Miniſtry <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> and <hi>Coram Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus,</hi> I count not two authorities, but the ſame, one Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority, which being derived to a man from the ſtanding act of Chriſts will in his inſtitution, immediately upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call, in the Court of Heaven and his own Conſcience, does not yet paſſe in the Court of the Church, till this call be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and confirmed by her Paſtors, which ſhe requires for Orders ſake, and calls Ordination. And here now is a firm and true foundation laid againſt that Objection, which is apt to riſe upon us, that if the Miniſterial power flows immediately from Chriſts charter and call, then may any man pretend hereunto, and take upon him to be a Miniſter without Orders, which were to open the door to Fanaticiſm and Confuſion: But God forbid we ſhould not be able to put a bar upon ſuch, which we can clearly maintain; It is this, to wit, that whatſoever a mans call is in the ſight of God, the Church is to take no cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of it, untill by ſome of her chief appointed Paſtors to that purpoſe, it be approved, teſtified, and declared by this Solemnity. If a man hath indeed abilities and a heart for Chriſts ſervice, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Let a <hi>David</hi> be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate for Adultery, he ſhall be held <hi>Coram Eccleſia</hi> out of the Church, as well as an <hi>Ahaz;</hi> let a man be truly called, while his calling is not approved by the Church, (which is by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) we ſhall not account him a Miniſter any more then he that is not called, and if a man be not called, yet if he be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61796:23"/>his Miniſtrations are not to be doubted of as valid to the Church, while he is to repent of his bad Conſcience before God. To give more life to this: As what hath been ſaid may appear from its own light, ſo will it appear more fully from the caſe of neceſſity, wherein the validity of the Miniſtry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Orders is agreed to by all. If the Miniſterial power did not come to a man <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> ſo that he is a Miniſter in Gods ſight before Orders, then could not neceſſity diſpence with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neceſſity falls not upon God, <hi>There is no impoſſible with him.</hi> But when the authority orders give, is only this authority <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Hominibus,</hi> that is the reception or acceptation thereof with men: (the value or eſteem of us as Miniſters at the Churches bar, in their ſight or account, what we are in Gods before) let a man plead impoſſibility, whether natural (as ſuppoſe him among the <hi>Indies</hi>) that he cannot be ordained; or moral (ſuppoſe him among the papiſts) that he cannot without ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nne againſt his conſcience; this plea, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impoſsibile</hi> is good at mans barr, for upon man neceſſity does come, and he is to be diſpenſed with, and his miniſtry therefore to paſſe, which elſe <hi>in Eccleſia rectè conſtitutâ</hi> were to be quite refuſed for orders ſake. I cannot omit here one <hi>ſimile</hi> to the ſame point, which is laid down ſtrongly by <hi>Grotius,</hi> De Imp. p. 270. <hi>Potestas marita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis est a Deo; applicatio ejus poteſtatis ad certam perſonam ex conſenſu vonit; quo tamen ipſum Jus non datur. Nam ſi ex conſenſu daretur, poſſet conſenſu etiam diſſolvi matrimonium.</hi> For my part I cannot but conceive thus; A man and a woman conſents in their hearts, and privately give the ſame to one another; This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between themſelves makes them husband and wife before God, and his ſtanding Law conveigheth to the man his power, and obligeth both to their duties: yet are they not to live together before marriage, if it were only for the ſhame, or ſake of the world, beſides that it is their duty hereupon (as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of publick order) to ſeek the matrimonial inveſtiture which is valid according to the Land: So is it here, when a man having Gods gifts does conſent ſeriouſly between him and his Soul to dedicate them to his ſervice, the ſame ſtanding law or will of his in his word or inſtitution about this matter, does make it his duty and give him power; yet is he not to have the exerciſe of it, before this inveſtiture of Orders, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the baſtardy of the Miniſtry that will elſe follow, when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61796:24"/>men ſhall be received without tryal and approbation; Nor only becauſe God commands this as his duty, ſo that he ſinnes (if it may be had) to neglect it; but becauſe the Church or People are not to receive or account ſuch as Miniſters, as they will not a couple man and wife, till the Solemnity. <hi>Let theſe alſo firſt be proved, then let them uſe the Office.</hi> In ſhort (as at firſt) They may be both (I ſuppoſe) held to be <hi>coram Deo</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſent only <hi>what</hi> they are not <hi>coram hominibus</hi> before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confirmation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. However we underſtand theſe words, this methinks might give a reaſonable man ſatisfaction, that it fares with us, but as with the Apoſtles themſelves; Chriſt had before given them miniſterial power, for they did preach and baptized while they continued with him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.2. and yet does he uſe this ſame form of words, that ſeems no leſſe than a new Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay that which is yet more, as Chriſt uſed this form but once, and that at their ſecond miſſion; So is it with us, the Presbyterian uſed it not at firſt, and we have it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I will ſuppoſe what is ſuppoſed, that <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is equivalent with <hi>Take thou Authority,</hi> and underſtand it of the miniſterial power, and conſequently that there is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over here a formal delivery of that Authority or Office to a Perſon, ſo that he may be ſaid to be made a Miniſter thereby as he was not <hi>(eo modo)</hi> before; and yet let us but underſtand alſo this aright as we ought, that it is all done only by way of external inveſtiture or ſolemnization as it is in the inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes (who are ſaid to be made Kings when they are Crowned or Annoynted) and there is no hurt at all comes to our Cauſe at laſt; which from thence indeed may have but the more clear demonſtration, how the thing may without any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in the world be done more than once. This I take to be the common Proteſtant doctrine, and reſt upon it.</p>
               <p>There remains now but one thing more, that after all this may beget ſome ſcruple, and that is, the inſtrument of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders There is that of the Deaconſhip, which if one does not like, he may be civil to the Biſhops Officers, and leave. For the other of Presbyter which is needfull for him to have, if it will not ſatisfie him that they are the Biſhops words, not ours, I will ſuppoſe he hath declamed himſelf before, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61796:24"/>is in his own hands. I ſhall ſay no more, but for my own part my Orders of Deacon (as quite uſeleſſe otherwiſe) I thought good to cancell, before whom it ſeemed to me fit, in teſtimony of my owning my former Miniſtry; and for thoſe of Presbyter which I keep, if any ſhould chance to ſee them, they may find theſe words, in the backſide, or bottom of them. <hi>I was ordained</hi> ſo long ſince <hi>by a Claſſis of the Presbytery, and doubt not therefore of being a Minister before, yet do theſe Orders make me ſo</hi> ſecundum ritus eccleſiae Anglicanae Canonicè &amp; legitime <hi>(ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this expreſs tenour) as I was not before, and in that ſenſe only have I ſubmitted to the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, If there was another form whereby our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry might be confirmed, or ſome Biſhops would vary this to ſerve a private turn, then were the <hi>Items</hi> my Adverſary hath given us ſufficient, to make us to chooſe and ſeek that rather than yield hereunto, for ſo far does his arguing reach, even in full force: but while there is no ſuch thing to be had, it makes it methinks a very high imagination, ever to enter the heart of a ſerious Chriſtian, if he can find it there too, to have his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſame mind with him, to think, that he, and they ſhould be ready to leave their holy Function and Charge (without ſome other conjoyned grand reaſon) rather than to bear with a little unhandſomneſs from our Superiours (for their Conſtitution's ſake) in the impropriety only of a forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which is not neither a matter of worſhip, and ſo as it is ſaid of <hi>Dani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HAving demoliſhed theſe two Forts <hi>in general</hi> which are the ſhelter of my adverſary, there are two arguments only <hi>in particular</hi> which he offers, the one is, from authority, and the other from the third Commandement.</p>
               <p>For authority He firſt quotes the 67. Canon of the apoſtles which I have my ſelf mentioned. Unto which, I ſhall only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him by way of anſwer, another of the ſame. <hi>Presbyter ab uno Epiſcopo ordinetur,</hi> Can. 2. Here I muſt put himſelf upon a ſolution if he comes off in another queſtion he handles in his book which concerns others, and he hath done it effectually, by a verdict of a Synod of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, An. 494. that theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons <hi>nullatenus recipit Catholica Eccleſia.</hi> He pleads farther, the practiſe of our Engliſh Church, which does not re-ordain a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Miniſter, nor thoſe formerly that were ordained beyond
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61796:25"/>the Seas; unto which he addes the ſtory of Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (which you may read <hi>Spotſwood Hist. of Scot.</hi> p. 514.) and alſo that the epiſcopally ordained were not conſtrained by the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, to be re-ordained after the mode of their Churches. As to all which, I account it were good for ſome of more skill in the hiſtory of latter times then I, concerning things of this nature to give us a relation of what hath been done in this caſe. There hath been examples no doubt of ſome that have, &amp; ſome that have not been re-ordained. That which I ſay to this argument meerly of practiſe herein, is, that it does truly ſeem very preſſing on the part of our rulers and impoſers, but as for the part of the ſubmitter, I cannot for my part but freely believe, that any, or either of theſe mentioned, might be ordained again if the exerciſe of their Miniſtry depends upon the ſame; and ſo I give in my anſwer. From a <hi>non ſolet,</hi> to a <hi>non licet,</hi> is a <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> And here I will not omit one pertinent relation. A preſent grave Miniſter and of note in <hi>Northampton ſhire</hi> (I have no commiſſion to print his name) being ordained in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> came to Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> he told him that they held his ordination valid; nevertheleſſe in regard of his ſetling in the Miniſtry here, he thought it good before they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ordain him again himſelf; giving him liberty in the point of Subſcription, and what Indulgence elſe he deſired I hear not. This inſtance is ſingularly full to my purpoſe, and being in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop who was ſo eminently a ſolid and pions Doctor, cannot but at the very ſight, remove ſome prejudice as to my opinion, and indeed as I hear, hath prevailed (it may be more then ſuch an argument alone <hi>de exemple</hi> ought) upon many. Let our Church Rulers be pleaſed but to tread in theſe ſteps, that is, declare our former Miniſtry hitherto to be good, require a new only <hi>ad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentem ſtatum;</hi> by the way of confirmation, vary a few of their expreſſions (where they ſee fit) accordingly, and give a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence as this above, in ſuch circumſtances as they find doe afflict any that are tender in conſcience and then I ſuppoſe both my brethren and I, and they and we, may ſoon come to compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in this controverſie.</p>
               <p>For the third Commandement, his other Argument, it is the ſame and no other then what I have laid down my ſelf in my firſt ſheets, to wit, the ſecond Objection there, which one would have thought might have ſaved my Opponent his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61796:26"/>as to the half of his work; for it is this one thing upon the matter is the ſubſtance of his Book, upon my queſtion; wherein, as ſoon as a man hath turn'd over any leaſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me, he may gueſſe what will be objected againſt me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand; The form namely, and the Ordinance in vain; that is, more words perhaps, but this Argument ſtill for the main; one <hi>light</hi> in a ſeveral change; the old Moon and the new Moon, but the ſame.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe when the objection at firſt came into my mind in thoſe ſheets (where I fetch what I have only from my own ſpirit as I go along) it did lye ſore upon it a good while, but I muſt needs ſay alſo, that the anſwer there I give to it, was as fully ſatisfactory to me as that was preſſing before, and I did think it would be ſo alſo to others, or elſe thoſe ſheets might hardly have paſſed my hands. It does therefore now ſtand me upon (though I have ſpoke to this there ſo largely already, and have ſome things alſo before which might be ſufficient) to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up together all the forces that I have had, or further have, to <hi>fight</hi> as it were at once, <hi>neither with ſmall or great</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, ſave <hi>with</hi> this his <hi>King,</hi> or maſter-argument he relies upon in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that is ordained</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>with a valid ordination, ought not to be reordained, becauſe by ſubmitting thereto, he doth take an ordinance of God in vain.</hi> This he proves. <hi>To take an ordinance for no end, or for no ſuch end as God hath appointed it unto, is to take it in vain. But to be reordained, after preceding valid ordination is to do ſo; becauſe ordination is to ſet us apart to the office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and we have the</hi>

                  <hi>already.</hi> This is his marrow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exact writing out more of his words, which I hope nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor I care to ſtand upon in this diſpute; Unto which I have therefore many things to ſay, for when I have in effect but one thing to ſpeak to, there are many things I muſt needs ſpeak to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a paſſage in an Author whom he otherwhere names with honour (as he is worthy) which I will ſet down in the firſt place, becauſe I cannot chuſe but receive it. <hi>We have no ground to think that the Apoſtles had any peculiar command for laying on of hands upon perſons in prayer over them, or ordination of them, but the thing it ſelf being enjoyned, the ſetting ſome apart for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the Churches by them planted, they took up and made uſe of

Now though Doctor <hi>Seaman,</hi> Mr <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters (to whom my Oppoſer turns us) may have ſpent their pains well to prove that no man may ordinarily enter the Miniſtry without Orders, while as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it, <hi>illa Apoſtolorum accurata obſervat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. I have diſtinguiſht plainly in my Book between our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the uſe and exerciſe of it, I deny that Ordination is in vain which is not to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Miniſtry it ſelf, and the reaſon is irrefragable, becauſe a man may be a Miniſter already and yet be ordained, as the caſe was with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas. Act.</hi> 13. which our Author himſelf opens, enlarges and grants, <hi>p.</hi> 4. I will put this in other words. Ordination is either to the office or to the work; Now I deny our Author his definition, <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ſetting a man apart to the work and Office of the Miniſtry,</hi> (in the ſenſe he underſtands <hi>ſeparating a man to his office)</hi> for we have but one place only, from which we gather this <hi>Genus definitionis,</hi> that Orders is a ſeparating or ſetting a man apart, to wit, that in the <hi>Acts. Separate me Paul and Barnabas,</hi> and there it is manifeſtly to the Work only, and not the Office which they had already, as himſelf, and I argue upon it, and I lay as the ſure foundation of our Caſe. It is true, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if you call that ſo) cannot be renewed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, but the Work may, the Work is. And if this pious man <hi>would not diſlike it</hi> (as he ſayes <hi>P.</hi> 4) <hi>if our Biſhops when any are removed to a new Charge would call their Presbyters,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch to the grace of God for their Work <hi>by the impoſition of hands,</hi> ſuppoſing that Text <hi>Act.</hi> 13. (which I mainly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) be warrant ſufficient for the ſame: It is not to be thought but another, who is, I will ſuppoſe juſt ſo much by aſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other ſide as he is toward his own, or poiſed equally, ſhould think it but a ſmall matter to be content moreover, that they uſe their own form, ſeeing they have yet no other, and our Reverend Epiſcopal men do not we know uſe to do ſuch things as theſe without their Order appointed. Nay if this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61796:27"/>may be done, as to the Work renewed in another place, why not I pray alſo as to the Work repeated in the ſame? ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at leaſt a man ſhall not be permitted to uſe his Miniſtry without it, and otherwiſe I perſwade not the tender to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is more here barely than this. The exerciſe of our Miniſtry is not to be conſidered at large, but reſtrictively, as to our Church. There is our Miniſtry, and uſe of it (I have ſaid in my Book) in our Engliſh Church. It is to the laſt only I count we are re-ordained. To which purpoſe we muſt diſtinguiſh of thoſe words of our Authors <hi>[after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding valid Ordination]</hi> Ordination is valid either in <hi>fore Scripturarum,</hi> which is <hi>vera</hi> only: Or in <hi>foro Epiſcopali ſive prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentis Eccleſiae,</hi> which is <hi>legalis,</hi> and Canonical alſo. Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Ordination is valid (we believe) in the firſt ſenſe, but in the ſecond ſenſe, our preceding Ordination is not valid, and ſo it is we are re-ordained. I return therefore the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; If when a mans former Ordination is valid, he may not, when it is not valid, he may, be re-ordained; but our former Orders are rendred by the change of the preſent times to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, in the ſenſe mentioned, and conſequently in that ſenſe may we take new, and in that ſence the form proper thereunto methinks alſo be born. Our Miniſtry was the ſame <hi>Silver</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Presbytery, but the Canonical <hi>stamp</hi> by the Biſhop, makes it received according to the conſtitution of the preſent Church; Even as the <hi>State-money,</hi> though current before, muſt ſubmit to be new coyned for all that, or elſe now it will not goe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſay farther hereupon, Our taking new Orders is not then the taking an Ordinance to no end, nay it is a taking them to a right end, the very end which by Orders is to be had: Ordination (this Author will ſay) is a ſeparating a Perſon to God. For what now I pray? why for the Work no doubt whereunto he is (or ſhall be) called. So in the Text <hi>Act.</hi> 13. The uſe then, and exerciſe of the Miniſtry, is the end to which a man is ordained. I will explain it by a clear place, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Thou ſhalt offer the Levites before the Lord,</hi> compare it with <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and it is, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſeparate them,</hi> that is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; Well mark then what follows, <hi>that they may execute the ſervice of the Lord</hi> There is the end. And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 22 <hi>After that they ſhall go in to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle.</hi> Now
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61796:27"/>have ſaid, though a man cannot be Re-ordained to his Miniſtry, (which he hath already) yet may he, to the uſe or exerciſe of it, to wit, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h: may <hi>go into the Tabernacle,</hi> that he may <hi>execute the ſervice of the Lord.</hi> You will ſay haply, theſe Levites and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to be conſecrate here to have their right to, or liberty of doing their holy ſervice in reſpect of God, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this before they enter upon their work; but we are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate again now only in reſpect of man, becauſe he requires it, or elſe will not allow this right and liberty to the ſame. I anſwer, this is true, and therefore let the Requirers look to it, when a perſon is conſecrate already to God, and thereupon he expects his ſervice from him, it man will hinder, let him ſee how he can anſwer it; but as for the Submitter, this is manifeſt, that whether he does this in conſcience to Gods command (as he muſt) at firſt, or in obedience to his Superiors, in the doing it again, yet is the end in both the very ſame, and that is only what is moſt juſt and honeſt, <hi>that he may execute the ſervice of his God,</hi> that he may have the free uſe of his Miniſtry in his place. And whether my Author dare ſay this is to no end, or not to the end proper to it, I leave it to his own breaſt to judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is not this one end only in Orders to ſeperate or ſet a man apart for his work, but others alſo, to wit, there is the invocation of Gods bleſſing upon us, aſſiſtance and <hi>grace with us</hi> in our work, which is ſo certain and plain, that when the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid in one place <hi>ſeparate to me,</hi> in another he tells us, <hi>they were commended to Gods grace. Quid aliud est manuum impoſitio niſi oratio ſuper bominem?</hi> ſayes St. <hi>Austine,</hi> as he is quoted <hi>De Baptiſ. contra Don. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 16. Now this end is repetible I hope, and if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere was nothing elſe, does alone take off the keeneneſſe of my Oppoſers edge. The Church I think may ſay her Prayers over twice, when Chriſt ſaid the very ſame words thrice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.44. But to ſpeak exactly, and to the touch of the word and truth, the ſeparating a man to God for his work, and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by Prayer, is indeed the very ſame. There is therefore another end, ariſing from the nature of the Solemnity that ſtands me in moſt ſtead: Ordination I have ſaid does not give the <hi>jus</hi> or ſpiritual power to a Miniſter before God; what then, (it may be demanded) does it give? why truly I have ſaid it, and it is ſo; It does give him his power or authority before
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61796:28"/>men, (that is, his authority comes hereby to be received) it does give him the repure and value of a Miniſter, as to all intents in the Church; And now for as much as a man cannot reape this effect by vertue of his former Orders he already hath, there is (as I have ſaid, and muſt ſay ſtill) the very ſame ground at this ſeaſon for Re-ordination, as for Ordination at firſt. Let my Reader ſee my firſt ſheets from p. 32. to 37. and though this Gentleman hath quite waved all that concerns this, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelf, (next to the plain Texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.) I place my chieſeſt ſtrength there.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where things are not unlawfull, not forbidden by God, why is it not an end ſufficient for what we do, to obey out Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlors, and that they have their end in it, ſuppoſing them (as in chàrity we are bound) good men, and that they aime at Gods glory in their commands? Nay, why is it not enough to follow prudence, what we judge moſt expedient, to ſtudy peace, to further our own and our neighbours good? Are not theſe honeſt and juſtifiable ends? It is true indeed, if a thing have evil in it, a good end will not juſtifie it, unleſſe that evil does ceaſe to be ſo in the compariſon; but I cannot lightly ſee evil in that thing which is neither againſt the light of nature, or poſitive inſtitution. Let me adde more particularly: In things which are at our Liberty, a man is not to walk only after his own conſcience, but to have reſpect alſo to the conſcience of thoſe with whom he is. <hi>Conſcience I ſay, not thy own but of the others,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.29. Thou art free for thy own part, as to the uſe of thy Miniſtry upon thy former Orders; but ſome perſons, perhaps thy Friends, perhaps of chief note in the Pariſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch as live up according to their knowledge, and indeed fear God, do think in their conſciences that you are not ſuch a Miniſter as you ſhould be, unleſſe you have Orders from the Biſhop, and whilſt their conſciences are ſuch, they ſcruple real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo haply cannot act in Faith, to joyn with you in ſome Ordinances, as the Sicrament, and the like. Here are they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed: They may not neglect their duty, and yet if they do it while they doubt it unlawfull to partake from you, they ſin, becauſe it is not in Faith. Now if by thy yielding to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou canſt bring ſatisfaction to their conſciences, and ſo gain them herein, why is not this end ſuch as is warrantable for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61796:28"/>thy ſubmiſſion? Nay if thou wilt not doe it, why may they not ſay <hi>Now walkeſt thou not charitably</hi> that ſeekeſt only thy own and not thy peoples ſatisfaction. <hi>Even as I</hi> (ſayes the apoſtle) <hi>pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking my own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. An Ordinance which is taken the ſecond time for the ſame end it was taken rightly at firſt, is not taken <hi>for no end, or for no ſuch end as God hath appointed it unto;</hi> for it is taken to the end he hath appointed it. But ſuch is our caſe in Re-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is taken for a ſolemn allowance or approbation of our Miniſtry, the recommending us to Gods grace for our work, the free paſſage of the Goſpell; And where the ends are repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible (as in preaching, praying, adminiſtring the Sacrament) and made neceſſary to be repeated, the means muſt be repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and repeated alſo. I do therefore deny his argument, which is founded ſtill on that only, that the miniſterial power is conferred by orders, and that that is the the only proper end thereof, which is but a ſuppoſition. VVhereas then he askes his friend, whether the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to him in his firſt Orders, and tells us thereupon, <hi>this is</hi> ludere cum ſacris, <hi>to have the Biſhop and his Chaplains pray that he may now receive that gift;</hi> this I take it, is a paſſage too low for this author; for let him ſeriouſly but remind the thing, and it is not like our Church ſhould paſſe ſuch an eſcape as to compile a ſtanding prayer for <hi>neceſſary effects,</hi> or accounted ſuch; ſhe may ſay in her ordering, <hi>modo imperativo, Take, Receive,</hi> the Miniſterial power, but ſhe does not pray <hi>modo optativo,</hi> that it may be given by the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then, he mentions, which is ſpoken of <hi>Timothy,</hi> there is no man can certainly tell what that <hi>Gift</hi> is. It may be the miraculous gift of the Holy Ghoſt given in thoſe times, or ſome extraordinary talent at leaſt not given to others. It is not unlikely, methinks, that <hi>Timothy</hi> might be ſo carefull and attentive upon the ordinary work of his proper charge, that the Apoſtle is fain to put him in mind that he wholly <hi>neglect not this.</hi> It may be likewiſe ſome further degrees onely, or the encreaſe of the abilities he had, and ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it, <hi>Deum cumulaſſe cum novis donis, vel priora duplicaſſe.</hi> Now if either of theſe be the ſenſe, as is moſt obvious, it is nothing for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61796:29"/>It may be alſo (to ſerve my Oppoſer) <hi>docendi of ficium</hi> as our <hi>London</hi> Divines, or the Miniſterial function, as hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it. Let us ſuppoſe this then with him (at leaſt till wee come to ſee it more unlikely) yet ſo long as it is ſaid directly of <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>in him,</hi> or given him, <hi>by propheſy,</hi> that is, ſo full and expreſſe a ſignification of Gods will (which I have touched in my firſt ſheets) as <hi>by Revelation:</hi> As the <hi>will</hi> of the Lord doubtleſſe, and that alone muſt be the fountain of his officers <hi>power,</hi> and that being ſufficiently ſignified muſt be enough to make a man his Miniſter; the impoſition of hands that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned beſides, can conduce after this, no otherwiſe indoed, but by way of ſolemnization. And ſo Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſayes of the like caſe, Acts 13. <hi>This impoſition was rather a confirmation, then a calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. I remember amongſt more impertinent things, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burdened my thoughts againſt Re-ordination, there was that text <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>VVhat thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Unto which, though I had theſe many reaſonings; That this text ſpeaks of thoſe precepts which were exactly commanded by God, but our matter is a rite taken up by the apoſtles proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of themſelves, as is noted at firſt; That God in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſtood more punctually (we may think) upon the exterual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance then under the Goſpel: That the thing we do meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is, making no more nor leſſe of it, only we uſe it over again, and repetition is not addition, in the ſenſe here at leaſt, where it is oppoſed to diminiſhing; That the Text forbids <hi>doing any other thing then the ſame</hi> God hath commanded (as not to follow the Heathen in their Rites in the verſes before) but it forbids not, the <hi>doing the ſame,</hi> upon occaſion; yet did not all this give full contentment to my mind (being weak) untill that inſtance came into it 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.31. where we have a ſpeciall Ordinance of God, the Feaſt of unleavened bread, which was expreſſely commanded to be kept ſeven dayes, and it is ſaid <hi>the whole aſſembly took counſect, and kept other ſeven dayes alſo.</hi> Now unleſs we ſhall think that the whole aſſembly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the meaning of that Text, or elſe did wilfully break it, here is repetition exactly proved no <hi>addition</hi> to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. This Inſtance therefore I will humbly advance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61796:29"/>in this place, to the farther lighs and ſatisfaction of our caſe. Here is (we ſee) an appointment of God, one of their three moſt ſolemn Feaſts; They had no precept nor preſident to repeat is; yet does the whole Aſſembly conſult and approve it, and though they did it of their own heads, and meer good wills, and to the ſame end only it was inſtituted, and already performed, yet dare not my Adverſary. I hope, accuſe them in it of taking an Ordinance in vain, or breach of the third Commandement.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let us know in the laſt place, that there are many things, eſpecially in matters of Ceremony only, and Order, wherein an Ordinance or Ordinances may be uſed, not only without its principal, but without its proper end, in caſe it be directed to an end of an higher nature and concernment, to the honour of God, and advantage of the Goſpel. Thus are thoſe Synodical Rites preſcribed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.29. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> keeps the Jews Sabbath, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.14, 42. Thus <hi>James</hi> and the Elders adviſe <hi>Paul</hi> to conformity to the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20. The great command which lies upon him, is to <hi>preach,</hi> and further the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. The Jews are never able to abide him, if he be againſt their Ceremonies; Hence does he therefore take their advice, and <hi>purifies himſelf, ſhaves, vows,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Samuel</hi> is commanded of God to annoint <hi>David;</hi> He fears if <hi>Saul</hi> hear of it he will kill him; upon this he pretends a Sacrafice and does it: Here is an Ordinance of God taken up for an end (we ſee) quite extrinſecal to is, yet is it juſtified by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon the account of his own Superior command, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 16. The moſt remarkable inſtance of all, is the Apoſtles circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing <hi>Timothy. Act.</hi> 16.3. where I will ask, to what end did <hi>Paul</hi> do this? not I hope to the proper end of that rite, for that were deadly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. but for the <hi>winning</hi> the Jews, the ſatisfying of them (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20.) the ſake of the Goſpel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>And this I do for the Goſpels ſake.</hi> We ſee then that an Ordinance may be uſed, and yet not taken in vain, although it be not directed to that end which it is properly appointed to, in the caſe of Superior command, or over-ruling reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61796:30"/>
               <p>There is ſome anſwer I find eſſayed to this by this Author, p 76. Circumciſion, and theſe Rites, he counts well, are aboliſhed ſince the death of Chriſt, and ſo I take it are called by the Apoſtle <hi>Ordinances of men,</hi> and <hi>Rudiments of the world,</hi> becauſe held in uſe by man, when they ceaſed to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God. Now if we ſhould queſtion whether <hi>an aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rite</hi> (or conſequently a meer humane Ordinance) <hi>might be uſed without its end, only in order to the propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> I perceive he would not gain-ſay it. But <hi>Ordination</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is not an aboliſhed Ordinance,</hi> and to take an Ordinance of God which is in force, and make it ſerve another end then that to which it is directed by him, this he thinks (I ſuppoſe) not juſtifiable by <hi>Timothies</hi> circumciſion. To reply, (beſides what I have inſtanced in Gods advice to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which cannot therefore be evil) we muſt diſtinguiſh here between <hi>the Rite</hi> it ſelf of Ordination, and <hi>the Forme</hi> wherein it is wrapt. For the Rite it ſelf, which is the Ordinance of God, (or rather an Apoſtolical practice we follow for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) it is directed to its proper end, when we are Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice, as when we are Ordained once, for we have the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit implored, or we are commended to the grace of God for our work thereby, as at firſt, and that is the principal end (not to name another) of this Rite, as it was Primitively uſed, if we will take the Holy Ghoſts own thoughts of it, who hath deſcribed the thing clearly but once, and that is thus, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.26. with <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. Yea, let a man only have a call to a new place, and my Adverſary himſelf does fully conſent with me in this. For the <hi>Forme</hi> then upon which he ſtands; It is true, that upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſuppoſition, there are words that conferre <hi>the Miniſterial power,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) which cannot be directed to that end in our caſe: But beſides, that this is a miſtake (thoſe words indeed being to be taken only as words of Inveſtiture and Solemnity not efficacy, that is, declaring, not conferring of power) I ſay that the forme, this <hi>Forme</hi> upon which he ſo beats, is not the Ordinance of God, but is for certain mans compoſure or invention, and ſo a humane Creature, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61796:30"/>of man; and conſequently though it were granted that an Ordinance of God might not be uſed to any other end, but that to which it is directed by him, yet does our force from theſe inſtances remain, becauſe that a meer humane Ordinance or Rite may, and he dare not gain-ſay it. Theſe Jewiſh Rites when aboliſhed were <hi>Ordinances</hi> or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>of men, Col.</hi> 2.20, 22. and they are ſo uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, I will conclude with the mention to my Reader of a convenient Book at this time, to wit, Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi> his <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Anglicanus,</hi> and if he will but apply thoſe Arguments he hath upon this head unto our ſingle caſe, I believe he will hardly eſcape unſatisfied from him, who does labour upon this very account to maintain in general, that it is neceſſary for a Miniſter to conform to the Ceremonies preſcribed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the caſe of deprivation. <hi>And the Watchman ſaid, If ye will enquire, enquire, return, come.</hi>

               <p>THus much for the Authors book it ſelf, and I hope I have not barely skimmed over his words, but ſet my ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow my pains upon his ſubſtance, where the water ſticks with him: And here perhaps ſome of his Brethren, when they ſee ſuch a point as this managed in effect with the force only of one Argument throughout, (which therefore I have ſo ſolemnly ſtood upon at once) may be apt to impute it to barrenneſſe, when others perhaps more ſolid, may take it but as a note of his judgement, that knows ſo well the very lock where indeed his only ſtrength lies. I proceed to hit Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, which he hath more particularly beſtowed upon me in his courteous Animadverſions; I ſhall therein humbly take the occaſion of ſupplying further notes as I go the way along with him over my own Papers.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61796:31"/>
               <p>In the firſt Section he begins with the kind notice of the occaſion that drew me forth on this ſubject, which I muſt commit to the Lord, who knows that many times the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal failings of ſome of his frail Creatures in thoſe things which are perhaps lawfull in themſelves, and good to others, may procure from him, the leaving them in thoſe perplexities from which they cannot get out again, untill they have run the gantilop through thoſe his providences which he hath appointed for them in the way to the ſhelter of their former quiet, and healing of <hi>his mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do humbly implore this in the firſt place, and muſt take notice at the beginning of ſome words of my own, where I ſpeak of having made no uſe of the notions of others, I muſt except ſo much light (beſides what elſe may be obvious) as I have In two parentheſis, (<hi>p.</hi> 33. and <hi>p.</hi> 83.) which fell in after I had done the reſt, yet cannot paſſe without confeſſion, and crave the Readers ingenuity. I have obſerved what a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſcape ſometime (as another would think) <hi>Auguſtine</hi> takes notice of himſelf in his Retractations.</p>
               <p>For paſſing my judgement on Re-ordination, I laid down as firſt two diſtinctions. There are ſome things (I ſaid) that are indifferent in their nature, ſo as in ſome caſe they may be done, and yet are by Divines indefinitely counted evil. And there is evil which is notional only, or moral evil. That which my Opponent ſayes to this, is only that he quotes Dr. <hi>Saunderſon,</hi> ingenuouſly intimating from whence I took my firſt diſtinction, and not diſallowing my ſecond, differs only in his verdict, that he accounts not this thing in the number of ſuch indifferents, (to wit, <hi>indifferentia ad unum</hi>) but a thing unlawfull, and not an <hi>imaginary,</hi> but <hi>morall</hi> evil. He does not give us any reaſon here, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> only paſſes to the next; but I deſire my Reader to note I do not leave the buſineſſe ſo, but when I have given in my opinion otherwiſe, I proceed in my diſcourſe, to lay down the nature of Orders, which I humbly offer as the free and open account for that my judgement. I have been therefore ſo large upon this before, as I muſt continue, and ſeeing this Author oppoſes nothing,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61796:31"/>but runs upon the common by as to the contrary, to wit, that Orders do give <hi>the Ministerial Authority and Office,</hi> which is not, I take it, well underſtood of thoſe themſelves that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. I ſhall ſeaſonably take here into remembrance, thoſe Arguments which the <hi>London</hi> Divines do offer for this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if <hi>they</hi> be anſwered, my Brethren I ſuppoſe will not be ſeeking to find out any, more likely or ſolid, from others.</p>
               <p>Their firſt Argument is this, <hi>If Election does not give the eſſentials of the Miniſterial Office, then Ordination doth.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. As for thoſe many eminent and learned Divines, beſides the Miniſters of <hi>New England,</hi> that do hold Election gives the Miniſterial Office, and theſe worthy judicious Divines of <hi>London,</hi> that hold Ordination doth it, may I think both fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part ſtakes. When the former do ſay and prove that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is but the confirmation of a man in his Office, not the giving the Office, I like well the liberty of their judgements; but when they have will taken from Orders this which is too high for man to aſſume, and give it to Election and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I underſtand not with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> I Judge clearly in the right here, who hath told us, <hi>Our calling is of God, and the Churches Authority is a Miniſtry to approve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that call.</hi> This I do aſſent to, in oppoſition to both of theſe Learned parties; to wit, that Ordination does not give the power or Office, but is only the confirmation of our call, againſt the one; and that that call is of our inward call by God, and not ſo low as the outward only of Election by the people. <hi>Ordinationis ritus eſt talis publica testification quâ voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, in conspectu Dei &amp; ipſius nomine, doclaretur eſſe legitima, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> ſayes <hi>Chemnetius.</hi> Unto which I will adde one ſignal teſtimony, and that is out of the Confeſſion of the famous Churches of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> ſpeaking that the Miniſterial charge it to be committed to ſuch only as are found skillfull in the Law of God, of a blameleſſe life, and to bear a ſingular affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Name of Chriſt (the three things our <hi>Perkins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acurately hath) it follows, <hi>which ſeeing it is the true Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, is tightly allowed by the conſem of the Church, and by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61796:32"/>laying on of the hands of the Prieſt,</hi> Harm. Confeſſ. printed <hi>Anglicae Cambridge,</hi> 1586.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Argument is from <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. Ordination does <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they preſſe the word <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. I anſwer this Text <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. is paralell with <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>(ſee Fulk in locum)</hi> and in both the word <hi>ordained</hi> (though the Greek differ) is taken comprehenſively, as it includes election, and ſo in thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>whom we may appoint,</hi> the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>we</hi> includes (I think) thoſe whom the Apoſtles ſpeak to, as well as themſelves, and makes for us; for is follows then, Ordination does <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>conſtituere</hi> or make a Miniſter, as election does, and election as ordination, that is, they do both go to the deſignation of the perſon, as in the making Magiſtrates in Corporate Towns, but the <hi>power</hi> does flow immediately from the Charter, from Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is from <hi>Ro.</hi> 10 15. this ſending (ſay they) is <hi>miſſio poteſtativa,</hi> a <hi>ſending</hi> with authority. I anſwer it is true (compare <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. with it) but this <hi>Authoritive miſſion,</hi> is not Ordination. This appears irrefragably by the climax in the Text, themſelves have noted, Without calling upon the name of the Lord, no ſalvation; without faith, no calling upon him; without hearing no faith; without preaching no hearing; and without being ſent, no preaching: conſequently if by <hi>being ſent,</hi> is meant Ordination, it muſt follow, without Ordination, no Salvation; which God forbid, ſeeing Hiſtories are not wanting to tell us not only of ſome perſons, but people (as I remember) have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by private Chriſtians, and ſcattered Diſciples which have not been in orders. ſee <hi>Theodorat lib. c.</hi> 14. <hi>et c.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> diſproving the opinion of thoſe that hold Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination ſo neceſſary, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t citra eam non poſſet eſſe Miniſterium in eccleſia,</hi> does quote <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt who preacht and baptized, and no doubt converted many, and <hi>Paul</hi> before the 13. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> who conſecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>varia ſacraficiorum genera</hi> (ſaies he) and had no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, <hi>Loc Com. De Ec. p.</hi> 849.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61796:32"/>
               <p>The fourth Argument is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. This <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they ſay here is <hi>Docendi officium,</hi> for which they quote thoſe two Texts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt confeſſe I my ſelf have been bended to this ſame conceit upon the ſcore of the laſt Text; but when I have more narrowly conſulted the ſame, I find that I and they have been quite out. The queſtion is, whether the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er reted Office? And if the Apoſtle does uſe it in that ſenſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, we ſhall be apt to believe it ſo here; if he does not, this belief will ſink of its own accord. Now then if we look the firſt of theſe quoted Texts, we ſhall find the word there to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo is a plain miſtake, that concerns not our ſearch. For the other Text then, let us look into it, and we find the Apoſtle does diſtinguiſh <hi>de induſtria</hi> between the two words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Gifts and Grace, and the one of them, according to the ſenſe there, muſt ſignifie authority and office, and the other endowments or abilities for the ſame. Now which of the two words is it that ſignifies the former? Truly one might think at the firſt ſight it were the firſt, being ready to read the ſenſe thus, <hi>Having gifts — whether propheſie or miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. making thoſe latter words (which import Office) refer to Gifts: But when we look better, we ſhall find otherwiſe, and muſt read the ſenſe of the words as in their own order they lye, to wit, <hi>according to the grace given to us, whether Propheſy or Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo theſe latter words referr indeed to the word <hi>Grace,</hi> which is the truth. That this may appear, let us know, that Grace property is Gods favour in general, and the word therefore is put in Scripture uſually for ſeveral effect; of it. Remiſſion of Sin and Reconciliation is one effect of his favour, and that is called Grace; The internal habits infuſed, Faith, Repentance, Love, &amp;c. are effects of his favour, and they are called Grace; The Goſpel is an effect of his favour, and that is called Grace, <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation to all men.</hi> So likewiſe is the putting a perſon into that Dignity to be one of his Miniſtry, an effect of his favour (and very great favour, if we can prize and uſe it right) and therefore the Office and authority of our Miniſtry is called <hi>Grace</hi> alſo, and ſo it is called <hi>Grace</hi> in the Text. I know not indeed of any that have ſaid this before me, but I am confident I am in the right, as my eye ſees, when the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61796:33"/>Sun ſhines. We will compare it with one or two Texts elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and no man ſhall be able to deny it. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.15, 16. <hi>I put you in mind becauſe of the grace which is given to me of God, that I ſhould be a Miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. And in the ſame Chapter here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>I ſay, through the grace of God given to me, to every one of you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought.</hi> What is that Grace there? but according to the <hi>authority</hi> I have as a Miniſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and admoniſh ſuch. And when we are come ſo nigh, no wonder if at the next breath as it were, the Apoſtle uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſame ſenſe, and conſequently the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be the more certainly and ſtrictly reſtrained to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, as diſtinguiſhed here-from; ſo that the meaning of theſe words are, <hi>Having endowments varying according to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice whe em he hath put us, let him that exhorteth wait on his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, and he that teacheth on teaching,</hi> &amp;c. I conclude this grand Objection with a double Note (that I may be ſure to run it quite through while I have it under my P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, to trouble me no more as it hath done) 1. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not uſed elſewhere in any ſenſe, but that writen is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eculiar to it; as when we ſay <hi>gifts of healing</hi> (See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where it is often iterated) we are not lightly to believe that it ſhould be taken in a forced ſenſe here without we had ſome ſupport for it. 2. That foraſmuch as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the general word put for ſeveral of its effects in Scripture, and this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is indeed one ſpecial effect in particular among them, diſtinguiſh'd by the Apoſtle himſelf from the reſt, to wit, Qualification or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities (whether ordinary or extraordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry) for ones office, as it is never taken our of its proper ſenſe elſewhere, ſo, for ought I know, it may not, without ſpraining the word quite, and puting its right foot out of joynt.</p>
               <p>The laſt argument is from the great ſolemnity of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the eminency of the perſons Ordaining, and the care they are to take in it: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. I anſwer, theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and the like, when they have enlarged them, may ſerve well to keep up the due credit there ought to be upon this ſolemn approbation of our Miniſtry by our Church Rulers, which, as God requires of them, leſt unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould pretend his call and intrude; So does he of us (if any of us have indeed his call) both for the benefit or bleſſing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61796:33"/>of thoſe Publick Prayers which we do humbly expect as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe end of this Rite, and alſo for the procuring us our <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Church, which is another, a <hi>Right</hi> whereunto is derived to us by the ſame. I deſire my Reader to mark this once for all, as a matter of more weight than haply he thinks of; It is not only that a man is hereby received as a Miniſter (which he <hi>was not</hi> before) but he hath hereby a right conferred on him to be received as ſuch (which he was not <hi>to be</hi> before) by the Church in the free uſe of his Miniſtry, and the people, that the command of God does take hold on them hereupon, to render that honour and obedience which is du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus much this argument of theſe my Reverend Fathers and Brethren of 0532 0 <hi>London</hi> may help to main ain, but otherwiſe I ſuppoſe it proves nothing; Of whom therefore I humbly take my leave, craving their pardon, that when I have found naught here, to glean upon the Vine of my proper Oppoſer, I have <hi>turn'd back my hand as a grape gatherer into their Basket.</hi>

               <p>Let me note here, when I ſay Ordination does ſet a man apart for the Miniſtry, I mean not ſo as that it gives it him.

               <p>I will enlarge a little here. There is a Fundamental right as Presbyterians ſay, and I believe, in every Miniſter to Ordain others, according to that rule, which is dignified by a great Pen, <hi>Ordinis eſt conferre ordines.</hi> Nevertheleſs when the Church came to ſee it good, for the avoiding of faction, and keeping peace, to give a preheminence to the Biſhop above the Presbyter, there is no reaſon, but the Presbyter, upon conſent, might as to the actual exerciſe hereof, <hi>de jure ſuo cedere,</hi> ſo as to Ordain none without the Biſhop, which comming more and more into debate, it is no wonder if you begin at the ſecond Canon of the Apoſtles, and goe over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Fathers, and find this ſtill the allowed prerogative of the Biſhop to have the power of Ordination, according to that which is ſo well known of <hi>Caſſander. Convenit inter omnes on Apoſtolorum aetate inter Epiſcopos &amp; Presbyteros nullum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen fuiſſe, ſed postmodum Schiſmatis evitandi cauſâ, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum Presbyteris fuiſſe praepoſitum, cut chirotonia, id eſt ordinandi poteſtas conceſſa eſt.</hi> Now foraſmuch as the authority of Councils, or Fathers, is received or not received of particular Churches, according to their proper concernments and complexion; As Presbytery hath ſerved her ſelf of the Scripture, to the neglect hereof, It cannot be expected but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy ſhould ſerve her turn likewiſe of Antiquity; which being added to preſent power, muſt needs diſcountenance other Orders, and if they come once not to be received and owned,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61796:34"/>the ground is laid for their refreſhment or iteration.</p>
               <p>I remember in the Council of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce</hi> we have this Canon, <hi>Can.</hi> 17. <hi>Si quis auſus fuerit aliquem qui ad alterum pertinet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare in ſua eccleſia cum non habeat conſenſum Epiſcopi ipſius, à quo receſſit Clericus, irrita erit hujuſmodiordinatio.</hi> Let me ask here any Divine, Presbyterian or Epiſcopal, Suppoſe a man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by another Biſhop than his own, and without his leave, is that man truly ordained or no? There are none in our dayes will deny it, and yet according to theſe Canons ſuch a mans Ordination was null, and conſequently if he would enjoy the uſe of his Miniſtry under his Biſhop he muſt be re-ordained. Now let any learned man tell me how ſuch Miniſters in this caſe could ſubmit to that Canon in thoſe dayes (which no doubt but moſt did ſubmit to, ſeeing that Council was ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique in the word) and then will our caſe be alſo opened and juſtified to my hands. In ſhort, it is ſufficient for the Church to receive a man as a Miniſter, that is Ordained only by the Presbytery, as of old by any Biſhop as their own, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture, which knows no difference between Biſhop and Biſhop, or Biſhop and Presbyter in this caſe, but it would and will not ſerve according to Eccleſiaſtical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what my Oppoſer ſayes here, and it is the ſame only he hath every where. <hi>If the Presbyterial ordination leave a man not capable of having any thing conferr'd on him but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the free uſe of his Miniſtry in the Engliſh Church, why will he ſubmit to ſuch a form as was purpoſely inſtituted to conferr the very Miniſtry it ſelf? why are ſuch prayers put up to God as ſuppoſe him to be no Miniſter?</hi> This is anſwered already, and we ſee the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the ſame ſtill.</p>
               <p>There is no form to be conceived ſuch, as to confer the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry it ſelf unto any, or to put up Prayers, <hi>that a man may be made a Miniſter,</hi> as he conjectures and ſpeaks, <hi>p.</hi> 68. I doe therefore produce him the very words of this form, to ſerve my turn. <hi>Take thou authority to preach the Word, and miniſter the Sacraments where thou ſhalt be appointed;</hi> which are ſo apt as if they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61796:35"/>&amp;c. unto which words in particular, and the form in general, I have ſpoken at large at firſt: What I muſt ſay over again to anſwer him as I go along, is; Our Ordainers muſt not be look'd upon according to this Author, as Creators of the Miniſterial power, which is given alone by Jeſus Chriſt, but as the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and approvers of his Will and Grant. There is indeed one grand Warrant (I muſt ſay) Commiſſion or Charter from Chriſt in general, empowring them who are qualified, as his word deſcribes, to be his Miniſters. The Ordainers now are to enquire whether a perſon have theſe qualifications, that is, as it were, whether he be in the Commiſſion, and then if he be found there, what they doe beſides, is but the declaring this, by the ſolemnity. The Commiſſion then or Miniſtry it ſelf is from our Lord, and Orders doe but give the ſame its free paſſage in the Church where a man is. Now this paſſage is hindred by the change of the times, and therefore, <hi>the Right Reverend</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>is troubled</hi> to remove this hindrance, and ſo, <hi>not to doe only what is already done.</hi> He is troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, not to make a man again a Miniſter of Chriſt, but a Canonical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter (if you will) of our Church, that is, to make him paſſe for ſuch according to their Lawes and Canons, when elſe he cannot paſs, and therefore is this alſo done by that form ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the words whereof, which ſtick, we are to conceive with all forms of Orders elſe muſt be interpreted only, as I have ſaid, to be declarative, not operative of our power, by way of inveſtiture, poſſeſſion, or ſolemnization. Even as it is in the inauguration of Princes, which as I have but now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in <hi>David</hi> above, and <hi>Solomon</hi> before, may be valid at firſt, and yet done over again, to eſtabliſh them more formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or <hi>legally</hi> amongſt their people.</p>
               <p>I will take a little liberty here of more words. Ordination I count is the confirmation, declaration, and ſolemn allowance of a mans Miniſtry by our chief Paſtors and Rulers, that may give us the value and recep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion as Miniſters to all intents in the Church, particularly for the execution of our charge where we are. Now there being none according to the form of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church and Nation, of authority to doe this but the Biſhops, though our former Orders have been ſufficient hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and are yet good as to our Right, yet growing inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (through this change) or enervate as to the <hi>effect,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61796:35"/>of them according to the preſent Polity (unleſs there be ſome myſterious danger in ſubmitting at all hereto) does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come expedient to us, and obliging; and obliging (without ſome other greater reaſon) becauſe expedient to us, for the ſake of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To advance this yet farther: There be ſome learned men do give much here to the Magiſtrate. <hi>Grotius</hi> (ſaies Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>commendeth the ſaying of</hi> Muſculus, <hi>that would have no Miniſter queſtion his Call, that being qualified, hath the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Commiſsion.</hi> I obſerve <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf does allow <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> of a Miniſter, diſtinctly to the Magiſtrate; and Dr. <hi>Seaman</hi> hath quoted <hi>Gerrhard</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; I might (I think adde ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, this is not enough; who would adviſe that they rather part quite, leave one another, and be no more Man and Wife, rather than be married again? Such is the caſe and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of ours in hand, for ought I can ſee, and no leſs, in this matter of Re-ordination.

               <p>A ſecond inſtance I have, is of the Oaths of Alleagiance and Supremacy: Theſe are taken at our Degrees, at our Orders, and upon particular occaſions, as the Law and Magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and yet cid I never hear any plead againſt this, that it would be taking an Ordinance in vain. Holy <hi>Bradford</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr tells his Judges, that he had taken the ſame Oath againſt the Pope ſix times: Unto this my Opponent ſayes nothing and indeed no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If that only argument of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in words be good, that <hi>a man cannot be Ordained twice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of Ordination is attained as one Administration,</hi> then a man may not have either of theſe Oaths twice adminiſtred to him, becauſe the end (to wit, the obliging a man to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: is attained at once; and ſo the Laws and Magiſtrate that require this on ſundry occaſions, do require the taking Gods Name in vain. Let my Author come off here if he can. The ſwearing by Gods Name we know is a ſolemn Ordinance, &amp; part of Gods Worſhi; <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. and if this may be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the forms of Courts, be order of the Law, &amp; command of our Superiours; let this be ſatisfaction likewiſe to us, that what is in vain, as to one end is not ſo to another; that what is in vain, in regard of ones ſelf, is not in vain in regard of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or ſatisfaction of others.</p>
               <p>A third inſtance is of the Lords Prayer, which we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in he Liturgy to be twice uſed in one Service.

               <p>For what I allege, that the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> I would not have this ingenuous Author think I place any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in it, only ſo far as concerns Authority: He knows (I ſuppoſe) that Divines ordinarily, Ancients and Neotericks, for want of ſome expreſs Text againſt iteration of Baptiſm (though the Unity there be indeed ſpecifical, not numerical) do plead thoſe words <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> when yet they have not yet ſo much as this to plead here, <hi>One Ordination.</hi>

               <p>Scandal, I humbly conceive, may be divided into that which tends only to diſpleaſure, or that which tends unto ſin.</p>

In this caſe, I ſuppoſe, though a man is not willingly to offend any at all, yet as to the main here, he is to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly with God, and his own Conſcience, and not to be much troubled how others do take it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a part of that Leſſon that Chriſt teaches us, to wit, <hi>of ſelf-denial,</hi> and the Light of Nature likewiſe, <hi>Ne te quaeſiveris extra.</hi> Nay, though a man ſhould haply hereupon go from my Miniſtry to another, I ſhould but be apt only to think he might profit better there. It is not this paſſive, but active Scandal (though I chuſe not to uſe School-terms) which makes us cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in lawful things.

In this caſe, a man (I judge) is to be much more tender and wary, ſo that if the matter be only of private concernment, he ſhould loſe very much rather, and <hi>non niſi paerè intolerabili difficultate</hi> (to uſe the words of <hi>De Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> this Author hath quoted in ſeaſon) be brought to do it: But if the matter be of publick concernment, to wit, in the commands of the Magiſtrate, or Church-Order, I cannot think that the grief of a Brother can be equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is probable, that this is that chief matter the Scripture does intend, when it takes ſuch ſpecial care againſt Scandal.

Thus perhaps is that great caſe in the Epiſtles to be underſtood, concerning the weak Jews, who were ſo held by the Law to their Ceremonies, and Meats, that they were ready to leave the Goſpel, rather than ſee them treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; from whence we may conjecture the ſenſe of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>For Meat deſtroy not the Work of God;</hi> Suppoſe it the work of Converſion, begun in ſuch a perſon, and <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy Meat for whom Chriſt died.

               <p>In the inſtance of the Apoſtle about meats, although he will have a man carefully abſtain, when he knows or is told that ſome are by, who are like to be ſtumbled at it, yet when he knows it not, or is not told ſo, he bids him eat with a free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and without <hi>making any queſtion; for the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> From whence I ſhall gather, that when a man hath conſidered the action he is about (ſuppoſe it required of his Superiours, and that he is ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of it) an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now if any of his Brethren, upon the relation hereof follows him, he ſhall not ſin againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe the liberty his Majeſties Declaration gives him, is to do it only according to his Conſcience. Again; Suppoſe another hath ſome of his People, that queſtion farther, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his reading, but their hearing, they think it ſin to joyn with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61796:40"/>him; if he ſhall read it then, he fears (and juſtly) that he ſhall lay a ſtumbling block in their way, and ſo may wound their Conſciences. Hereupon, he goes to every one of theſe parties privately, and ſatisfies them of the lawfulneſs of what he does, and perhaps, for their ſakes, will omit certain paſſages which they cannot bear; and if there remains but one or two haply unſatisfied, he wiſhes them to lay down their Erronious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as ſoon as they can; but in the mean time, if they cannot, (ſeeing it does <hi>ligare,</hi> though not <hi>obligare</hi> (as Divines ſpeak) and they muſt not go againſt it) to forbear coming in a while till the Pſalm; and ſo is the Scandal obviated, as to them, and he left free as to others, to the general edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I am here led by the way to anſwer one Objection concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Common Prayer, becauſe I perceive it does begin to ſink upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61796:40"/>holy Name, according to the Scriptures and his own Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. If this Argument were uſed againſt the Ceremony of bowing towards the Communion Table, it might haply come cloſe. That Act of Adoration certainly is given by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to the Bread which they believe to be Chriſt himſelf, ſo that a Brother may ſay here truly, <hi>This is offered to an Idol.</hi> The Apoſtle then ſaies, <hi>Do it not for his ſake.</hi> One may ſay, I do it only as the Ancients, <hi>Bowing toward the Eaſt,</hi> in token of Chriſt's Comming; <hi>Not to the Altar,</hi> as the Papiſts, in token of his Preſence there. But this I doubt will not ſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not to the point; The point in earneſt lies not upon thy Conſcience, but on the Conſcience of him that ſhews it. The ſtrong Chriſtian might ſay as well, he knew that an <hi>Idol was nothing,</hi> and had his account to himſelf, yet muſt <hi>not he eat for Conſcience ſake;</hi> What Conſcience? Why, <hi>not his own, but the others, v.</hi> 29. to wit, that are ſcandall'd at it. Whether this can be anſwer'd (I confeſs) I know not; But for Common-Prayer only, if the ſtrong Chriſtian I account, could have ſaid to his Brother, You are miſtaken Sir, you have been told falſe, this meat was not offered to an Idol, there had been an end between them; So is the anſwer in this matter.</p>
               <p>To return to our particular point of Re-ordination We may conſider, a man may perhaps in the firſt place avoid the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal by doing it in private, that none know of it; If not ſo, thoſe that are capable to be ſcandalized in this ſenſe we ſpeak of, are but our fellows in the Miniſtry, and we are not ordinarily to ſuppoſe them as weak Brethren, but to have knowledge; if they have not, there is a good ſpace likely between thy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and theirs, that they may inform themſelves, which we may believe of them, and ſo the fear be the leſs, that they ſhould be wounded by us; However, I will ſuppoſe that a man does conſider whether there be any about him like herein to follow his example; As for ſuch as ſpeak againſt him for it, or give him ill words, he paſſes; but as for ſuch as approve it, and are pleaſed with him, as glad perhaps to be born <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And here for the diſcharge of my own Soul, in reference to ſuch who may be induced by me unto this thing, I muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lay two charges upon them; The firſt is, that they do throughly ponder the Book of Orders, and every thing beſides, that will be required of them, before-hand, and if they be not perſwaded in their minds that it is lawful for them, let them not do i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Chriſt was baptized, we know; That Baptiſm was for remiſſion of ſinns, whereof Chriſt was uncapable, we know likewiſe, and conſequently, that an Ordinance may be uſed by a man who is not capable of its grand end, but ſome other, is proved; But with what <hi>form</hi> of words (whether any or none) <hi>John</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Jeſus with, neither I nor he do know.

               <p>And here I find next, he hath made a great skip; for when I have ſaid, there are more ends than one in Orders, I open my ſelf. <hi>Ordination gives a man his Commiſſion (according to others) and inſtalls him in it; it makes a man a Miniſter, and alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies him to be ſuch before men; it gives the Office, and alſo makes him</hi> received <hi>at ſuch in the Church where he is ſent.</hi> It is true, a man who is ordained already, is not capable of the one end, but he is of the other: He that was a Miniſter before, cannot be made ſo now, as to have the Office given him, but he may have the ſame Office declared or ſignified, I hope, more then once (as in the Inauguration of Princes) when there is need for the better execution thereof, and acceptation with the people. This my Opponent ſhould not have paſied, as alſo that I am wary ſtill of the firſt of theſe ends, to ſay I do <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> it only, and not <hi>grant</hi> it: It may ſuffice, that I have in my firſt work maintained my queſtion, notwithſtanding that ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which, many of my Brethren perhaps would ſcarce have received it into their thoughts to digeſt it: But now the light I will conceive, may have broken in at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon their minds through the cranies I have there, I may follow the ſame here more o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the Precedent I find one, which is moſt appoſite in the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews Hiſ. Scot.</hi> p. 451. One Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> having Preached ordinarily in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> ten years upon the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here I note, that a man who is acknowledged a Miniſter already, may be Ordained by the judgement of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, even of the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves; And that the account I offer is not Independent; the ſtory goes on, and tells us further, this was the form they agreed upon, that <hi>the Impoſition of hands was not uſed as a Ceremony of his Ordination to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but of his Ordination to a particular Flock.</hi> This was acted <hi>Anno</hi> 1598.</p>
               <p>For ſatisfaction upon this, whereas we have the diſtinction here between a general and particular Ordination; I deſire this particular Ordination be underſtood, not to the <hi>Office,</hi> but to the <hi>Work.</hi> It is the Independent tenent, I take it, that all power Chriſt hath given to the <hi>Church,</hi> is to be applyed to the diffuſive body, and ſo they account it is the people by their choice do conſtitute their own Paſtor in that individual rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Conſequently, when that particular gathered company diſſolves, that man ceaſes to be a Paſtor, and while it laſts, upon the ſame conſequence, he cannot ever ſeparate from it, <hi>Relata mutuò ſe ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> For my part, who am apt to believe that Chriſt hath given Paſtors and Teachers to his Church, only as Catholick, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

But when a man is already of Miniſter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, to have a particular laying on of hands only, unto the work unto which he is called in a ſeveral place, I am aſſured in my belief, that we are moſt fully waranted by this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And here I cannot but obſerve farther the gracious providence of God, which for the time hitherto, as it were determined our caſe. Our preſent Eccleſiaſtical Rulers would not let a man have Inſtitution without Epiſcopal Orders; and there hath been <hi>an Act of Confirmation</hi> of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters already, in any living, though ordained only by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Now then if any of my tender Brethren, ſcrupled this buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, as being without precedent, if they were already in a living God provided againſt their ſcruple and confirmed them. If they are out of a living, then God hath provided for them in his Word, this inſtance undeniable of <hi>Paul,</hi> that a man who is a Miniſter already, may be Ordained for all that, unto the particular work of that new place, whereunto he ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And why may not this be ſtrengthned from the <hi>Prieſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, who though he was dedicate to God and his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at once, did conſecrate himſelf often to ſome particular ſervice upon emergent occaſions?

               <p>It is a ſerious queſtion I propoſe, therefore in my Book, when we ſee in this place for certain (by this inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>) that <hi>the reaſon</hi> of Ordination is not for to give the Miniſterial Function, and the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>Why really (I ſay) I think it is this; This ſolemn Rite does give an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Authority before the Church, that is, the current re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or valuation to a man of a Miniſter: So that he who was truly called of God before, is now received as ſuch, by all, as to the exerciſe of his Function, with freedom and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</q> I cannot expreſs my ſelf more fully, not argue more firmly than I do upon it. The Reaſon of a precept is to be look'd on as the Precept: but the reaſon why we ſhould be ordained at all, does now ariſe upon us to be re-ordained (to wit, becauſe elſe we cannot have this reception, or enjoy this End of Ordination, thus expreſt, in our Church) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo far as we have Precept, or Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here, there is but one thing ſince, I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, hath ever been upon my mind to give any check unto this, and that is, if the End I ſpeak o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where we have a kind of Divine Ordination of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by lots: It is ſaid <hi>v. ult. They gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon</hi> Matthias, <hi>and he was rumbred with the eleven Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> Here it is apparent, that the immediate effect of this external ſignification of Gods Will by lot, whereby <hi>Matthias</hi> is conſtituted one of the Apoſtles, is this ſame <hi>value, repute, account, as an Apoſtle</hi> (or as a Miniſter, which I ſtand upon) He was <hi>numbred,</hi> that is, with the moſt Learned, only repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reckoned, acknowledged amongſt the Apoſtles.

               <p>And here there be ſome (I ſuppoſe) of my Epiſcopal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may act upon ſuch an account as this: The Presbyterians have thought it good in their Orders to have no ſuch Form of Words as are actually conferring of power (the true reaſon, by the way, though they have not all known one anothers minds, being indeed, leſt we ſhould think the ſpiritual power it ſelf to be conferred hereby, which is but the outward inveſtiture only) and hereupon they are apt to think ſuch no Miniſters, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power, and ſo ordain them again. But though I take this to be the very beſt plea that ſuch who go ſo high can have, yet muſt I needs judge it a conception both injurious and fond, to believe, that a man who is ſet apart to the Office of a Miniſter by all other ſolemnity that is needful, ſhall yet have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given him by God, for that Office only, for the defect of a Formality. That there are not ſuch words uſed as are in the Epiſcopal Orders, is a conceit never like to lodge with me.

               <p>There is one thing only remains to be vindicated in this Section, and that is, that other inſtance I have produced for me on this ſubject, to wit, of the Apoſtles themſelves, who are ſent out by Chriſt with Authority to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.7. in his life, and yet after he is riſen, he renews
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61796:46"/>their Authority, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> There is a ſecond miſſion, and yet is not this all, for if we mark the Text, we find that this was the ſame day at evening (<hi>v.</hi> 19.) when he roſe, while his Diſciples are in a houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> expreſly not with them, <hi>v.</hi> 24. There muſt be another time therefore, wherein this Commiſſion is again delivered, unleſs <hi>Thomas</hi> had not the ſame Power or Commiſſion with the reſt, and that we have expreſly on a Mountain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> where Chriſt had <hi>appointed</hi> them to meet him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. And there is their grand Commiſſion finally repeated and eſtabliſhed. <hi>Go, Preach and Baptize, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> Now let the queſtion (ſay I in my ſheets,) be put then, to the higheſt, whether an Authority or Commiſſion to an Office or Work, may be renewed? (even ſuppoſing Orders did give the Miniſterial Authority) and it is here exemplyfied and proved in the moſt ſignal Preſident we can have in the earth. Who can think that to be unlawful, which Chriſt did to his Apoſtles himſelf? But I will not let this go thus.

If that be true, then ſhould I never plead for Re-ordination ſure, then muſt I be ready to think it Sacrilege as ſoon as any; but this certainly can n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To ſave their curſe, I deny not, with our <hi>Hooker,</hi> and <hi>Maſon,</hi> if by their Character they mean only <hi>ſpiritualis poteſtas</hi> (as ſome of them do) that there is ſuch a thing, (and they <hi>quoad homines</hi> we may ſay impreſſed hereby) which our Divines alſo do hold indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; So that the <hi>Office</hi> being once received cannot be taken away, even by degradation it ſelf, though the <hi>Work</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be made to <hi>ceaſe.</hi> Now if it were Orders did indeed give <hi>this power,</hi> as my Oppoſer, with the moſt, do think, then muſt thoſe Orders we take firſt, ſtand good and valid againſt any other we take after (if there were twenty) which can neither make nor marr, as to that end, which is already attained thereby. And here in the way may be one plain Conviction on this Gentleman, that when he does plead, that I make null my firſt Ordination and therefore my Profeſſion will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt my Fact, he quite interſares with himſelf, who ſtill pleads all the way beſides, that my firſt Orders having given me my Miniſtry already, it is that renders my ſecond in vain.</p>
               <p>There are two Books (let me therefore here mention it) come out againſt Re-ordination, one before, and this Author; two Arguments it is they harp upon; The former ſtands
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61796:49"/>mainly upon this, That a ſecond Ordination does in the fact make null the firſt; The other inſiſts upon this, That our firſt Ordination (if he be underſtood as he muſt) does null the ſecond, to wit, by rendring it in vain. Now let u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſet theſe two Arguments together by the ears, and they muſt needs fall by the hands of one another; for it a mans firſt Ordination be indeed made null, then is not his ſecond in vain; and if his ſecond be in vain, then is not his firſt null. The truth is, were the ſuppoſition true which they go both upon, it is the laſt Argument were of force, and the former muſt be nothing.</p>
               <p>Neither would it hence follow, becauſe the Character (if one will call the Power or Office ſo) is not repeated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rite (which does ſolemnize it) may not, any more, than becauſe the Regal Office, is but one and the ſame (which muſt be ſtill urged) therefore the annointing or in eſtiture can be but once alſo. If a man who is Conſecrated, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his firſt Ordination, and ſteal away himſelf from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry into the Laity, when he believes God originally called him, and his labours like ſtill to be ſerviceable to him, not diſabled, not put to it, by diſtreſs, or force, for the ſafety of his Conſcience, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ene, linguam corrige,</hi> and ſay, if they will keep their words, they muſt correct their apprehenſion. I do like well indeed to ſee the meaning of this Author to be ſo full, who thinks that to be re-ordained, does offer injury to our Miniſtry it ſelf, as if we did thereby even <hi>recede from our Office,</hi> (the contrary whereof is true) or vacate our Miniſterial Acts, which might well highly provoke his quickeſt worth and zeal againſt it; but when perhaps he hath let his thoughts cool a little more on the matter, he may come to conceive with us, that the Miniſtry it ſelf is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by our Orders at the firſt, and conſequently that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be endamaged by being re-ordained in the leaſt, but that theſe Orders firſt and laſt both do operate upon, or to the ſame, only by way of declaration before men, for the reception of us in the Church, where we are (as hath been ſaid) no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than we ſee the like of Princes as to their Kingdoms, in the inſtances now mentioned, and ſcarce yet out of ſight.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot ſay, but we may divide perhaps between the Miniſtry it ſelf, and our Orders; the Miniſtry, which is from Chriſt, and his inſtitution alone, and Orders which are of man. Let us be allured in the firſt place, that our Miniſtry, or Office it ſelf, receives no damage by theſe ſecond Orders, (which a man does not indeed recede from, but cleave to thereby) and the great fear is over; and as for our former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders barely, whether they receive any injury hereby or no, it may be perhaps another matter. For my part I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is injury offered to the ſame, but I will not ſay hereby, in what we do. The doing injury is one thing, and the ſuffering injury is another; we are here but ſufferers, It is a Chriſtians du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Let me ſay then, it is even the duty of theſe firſt Orders of ours, to ſuffer wrong in this caſe, ſo long as it is not from us who cannot help it. The wrong is, that we cannot enjoy that right we ſhould have by them, and while by taking new, we do but purſue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>firſt,</hi> and cannot now have it upon their ſcore they ought (at I may ſo ſay) to be content with us, and put it up from the time. We do not our ſelves, think the worſe of them for being vilified; Beſides,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61796:51"/>let the Biſhop think them to be null, and we think them to be good, our thinking is nothing to the thing it ſelf, if they be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid indeed, and according to truth, they will be ſo, whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think ſo or no; and we <hi>go</hi> no more from any thing we have by them, by taking new, than we do go from the wealth we have, when we get more.</p>
               <p>What then is the matter here in good earneſt? Why the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, you may ſay perhaps, will at leaſt make men think our former Orders to be null, though they be not, and this is ſomething.

               <p>The firſt and chief end (as moſt expreſs) of this Rite, is, the commending a perſon to the Grace of God for this Charge of the Miniſtry that is now ſo ſolemnly laid upon him, which is all one as to ſay the ſeperating, conſecrating, or ſanctifying him by prayer, as to the Act of the Ordainers; and in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to the Ordained, the bleſſing, grace, preſence, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Spirit upon, and with him, for his ſtudies, work, and ſucceſs, thereby obtained. <hi>Praecipuè ſervatur iſte ritus, ut tota eccleſia communibus precibus deo miniſterium vocati com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendet,</hi> ſayes <hi>Chemnitius:</hi> Which Prayers we are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be <hi>inanes</hi> but though there is no promiſe (it is true) extant in Scripture, whereby God hath obliged himſelf to give Grace (or Gifts) in the adminiſtration of this Rite, as there is to the Sacraments; yet may our Faith be ſtrengthned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome benefit more peculiarly upon theſe Prayers, when this Impoſition of hands, according to Apoſtolical practice, is joyned with them, from ſuch Texts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.16.

               <p>The ſecond End hereof, is the Conciliating to a perſon an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61796:53"/>Authority in regard of men (which I make ſo much uſe of) that his Miniſtry be <hi>received</hi> (I ſay) thereupon by all in the Church where he is. This, as to the Act of the Ordainers, is their publick teſtimony, approbation, and declaration of him as called of God; and in the Effect to the Ordained, is this his <hi>Reception</hi> (I ſo much preſs) by the Church, as to the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, and acceptation with his people. Now though it be true (what I muſt finally inculcate) that our firſt Orders, or ſolemn approbation by the Presbytery, hath given us a <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght</hi> from God, or from his Word, to this Reception mentioned: Yet ſeeing (I account) we cannot have the <hi>Fruition</hi> hereof without the Canonical allowance alſo of the Biſhop, and it is the actual enjoyment hereof (I ſay) in the preſent exerciſe of our Function, and free courſe of the Goſpel, is the ultimate end here without queſtion we look at in Orders, it is this Reaſon muſt warrant a man in his ſubmiſſion, though nothing I know will the Impoſition of Re-ordination.</p>
               <p>There remains now the laſt Objection in my ſixth Section and that is from Baptiſm; Baptiſm cannot be iterated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not Orders. My Anſwer to this is, There is not here <hi>par ratio,</hi> Baptiſm is a Sacrament, and there is a promiſe of Grace annexed to Sacraments, and that as to Baptiſm is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which whether real or relative is but once, and therefore Baptiſm is not repeated; but there is no ſuch Grace and promiſe to Orders. <hi>Quod Baptiſmus non ſit iterandus de re magna agitur,</hi> ſayes an eminent Doctor. And for the Papiſts then, <hi>Quod Baptiſmi proprium eſt ad Ordines ſuos conferre,</hi> he accounts not equal. See <hi>Exam. Con. Trid. de charactere.</hi> This is my Anſwer. Nevertheleſs, in regard that the dread which is upon mens Spirits in this thing, does mainly I think ariſe from hence, I thought good to add thus much farther up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truths ſcore, to wit, That howſoever the univerſal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church ſtands firm againſt Re-baptizing now, yet we find in the Scripture, that there hath been ſome particular reaſons, that even Baptiſm it ſelf hath been repeared, and the former not renounced, but confirmed hereby. This is in the inſtance of <hi>Act.</hi> 19.5. which I have opened there. For reply whereunto, my Opponent, after the quoting of <hi>Voſſius</hi> againſt Re-baptization (which might as well have been a hundred)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61796:53"/>and <hi>Optatus,</hi> who hath belike a ſingular conceit that <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to theſe Diſciples was null, becauſe it was after Chriſts Precept was given, who in the mean while forgot ſure that plain Text, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.22.23. that <hi>Jeſus baptized</hi> (which was by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.2. and they could not do it without a Precept) when <hi>John</hi> did; I ſay, after this he comes to confeſſion, in the end, of two or three literate Pages &amp; grants theſe Diſciples firſt Baptiſm good, and yet re-baptized, and not only ſo, but becauſe <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm was <hi>in eum qui veniret,</hi> and Chriſts was <hi>in eum qui jam veniſſet,</hi> and ſo not the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he adds, <hi>there was as much ground to adminiſter Chriſts baptiſm after Johns, as Johns after Circumciſion;</hi> Here then is there a good plea for us. Whether a man is Circumciſed or Baptized, Baptized into Chriſt to come, or already come; Circumciſion and Baptiſm both was ſtill an external entrance or admiſſion into the Church and Covenant of God; and conſequently, if the entrance into the Church may be ſolemnized more than once, the entrance into the Miniſtry may be ſo, I hope with leſs ſcruple. Thus we ſee not only that this Argument comes to nothing againſt us, but may happily be rather inverted for us; So that it fares here with this Author methinks according to thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Either the Bud does yield no Meale, or if it do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yield, the Stranger</hi> (his Adverſary) <hi>ſwallows it up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the cloze I find methinks a little leven in the mind of my Adverſary, which it may be, ſome or other of my expreſſions, being not grave enough, or too much engaged, might raiſe. If I be culpable I am ſorry, but for my part I ſhall return no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that nature, but my reſpects, which he hath merited I connt highly, that he hath been ſo fair all along before. And as for what he objects, <hi>why was not Mr.</hi> H. <hi>as tender to be re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſtop the mouth of peeviſh people heretofore, as well as now?</hi> I with heartily that the anſwer were not ſo eaſy as it is, to wit, <hi>can ſa patet.</hi> It was little glory to <hi>Paul</hi> that he was a Phariſee, in compariſon of his being a Curiſtian, and yet in how much ſtead did a ſeaſonable owning thereof ſtand him in? <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6.

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e this man does think, that if he, or other like worthy perſons, ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61796:54"/>do as I have done, the better ſort of their hearers would be ſo offended, as to leave them; but if by the better, he means the <hi>ſober</hi> as well as the pious, I dare undertake for them, that if he cannot otherwiſe enjoy his Miniſtry, they ſhall go near to be the firſt, to adviſe him to it. For my part, when I ſee a worthy Miniſter of Chriſt, that doth much good, and Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe times, and another who is <hi>a thing in Paſtors cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ready to deſpiſe him as no Miniſter, only becauſe he had not the ſame Orders himſelf hath, and many of his Pariſh joyn thoughts with him; Methinks a kind of pious ſcorn and juſt indignation only might ſerve him, to let ſuch know how eaſy this Ceremony might be had if he pleaſed. And truly as for ſome young men who have been taken by Presbyters into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for their piety, and gifts, and not the Univerſity ſake; I ſhould be apt to adviſe ſuch here unto, of choice, (if their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſerve to hold out) for the ſake of the Goſpel, leſt their Miniſtry elſe in ſhort time come to be contemned, when men of known learning, if they ſtand out, are not ſubject to that diſparagement; Nay farther, whereas it is in the mouths of mon, that unles they do this, they can have no preferment, and that is judged a carnal argument (as this Author at firſt beſpeaks his friend to that pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſe) We are to conſider well, before we condemn any. If a man ſhall think Re-ordination unlawful, and be tempted to do it upon preferment, the Lord rebuke the tem t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion, and forgive him,. If he think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſome conceived advantges beſides the Goſpel draws him in, when elſe he is loath, this argues the mind unfixed and does alſo need mercy, But if a man is deſtitute of a place, and meerly for the ſervice of God in his calling, becauſe he cannot elſe have another, does ſubmit hereunto, and call this <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> you may pardon the mans words, but his meaning is ſuch, as includes the true end, why the thing indeed is to be done. I ſay not this to <hi>entice</hi> any to go on farther in theſe times, than their hearts ſerve them, or that they ſhould not conſider when they do this, how far they are to paſs beſides: He is a wary perſon, that will go in at no gate at firſt, until he is aſſured well, all the others alſo, that lie in his way, are open. But I ſpeak it, becauſe the great concernment of the Goſpel, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the work, the pleaſure and readineſs of the fleſh, to be diſcharged, the ſelf-denial in bearing the brunt, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61796:54"/>duty (as men are beſt fit for doing ſervice) are not weighed like wiſe as fully, I doubt upon the contrary. And ſo I have done with this Opponent, and what I have ſaid to him, may ſuffice I hope for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> alſo, for he that anſwers the one, muſt alſo (as to the main) anſwer the other.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61796:56"/>his Worthies had fetch'd it to him, he judged the thing ſo ill, to have hazarded the life of thoſe valiant men, upon ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when it was not on neceſſiry, or for the ſaving of his own, that he laid this pennance, at juſt on that appetite of his, that cauſed it, to deny and croſs it, ſo that he would not drink thereof, but powred it upon the ground. I could willingly do ſomething the like with theſe Orders of mine, if I have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded any of my <hi>worthy</hi> Brethrens Conſciences by Scandal in the doing.</p>
               <p>It is truly an irkſom thought ſometimes to me, to hear how ſome of our Biſhops do expect not only that a man ſhould be Re-ordained, but that we ſhould think our former Miniſtry to be null too, until that be done. If this indeed (as one might think) were perſonated only, it would vex a man to the heart, that ever any of us ſhould yield to be ſo un-ingeniouſly dealt withall; but when we ſee the <hi>real</hi> confidence with which they carry it, ſo that for ought I ſee, they do believe themſelves verily in it, inſomuch as ſome of them when they have done, have bid thoſe whom they have Re-ordained, to repent of their Miniſtring the Sacraments before, it may overcome out indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation methinks into a melting affection, or ſmile at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and make us bear with them. As if indeed the Biſhops name were diſtinguiſhedly in <hi>Chriſts Charter</hi> for Ordination, as it is in the <hi>Canons</hi> of men; or as if any ſhould tell me in earneſt, that the <hi>Lawne</hi> were <hi>de eſſentia</hi> to the Ceremony, and the hands availed not without the Sleeves on.</p>
               <p>The truth is, while there was ſome fair and lively hopes of an accommodation between Epiſopacy, and the ſober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of the Presbyterians and others, according to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties gracious Declaration, the buſineſs of Conformity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Primitive Pattern, might look ſomething lovel; but now it hath pleaſed thoſe that ſit at the Helm of theſe things, to carry their affairs ſo high, that our expectations that way are cut off, and the <hi>thirſty of the Land,</hi> after ſome good iſſue thereof, <hi>made to fail.</hi> I do not know of what conſequence the removing from our ſtation at firſt may be, or to what Rock it may come. When <hi>Paul</hi> had preſaged the Voyage to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the minds of the Shipmen miſ-give them themſelves, though the winds blew ſoftly, and the temptation was ſtrong, the Centurion did not well to ſet out, or venture on, and ſo

Unleſs I could be ſure my heart would ſerve me to hold throughout, and I could ſee ſafety there, at the end, I will not ſtand the danger of having gone ſo far, but will rather diſcount my action, and crave mercy, than look to be juſtified by what I have done. A Traveller goes on his way, and comes to two Ditches, he makes a ſhift to get over one, but then ſeeing another ſo broad, and how deep he knows not, he ſteps back. I do perceive I have made ſo large a ſtride at once, though in a little thing one would think, that I have left moſt of the wary and conſiderate of my Brethren behind me, I mean ſuch at leaſt, where neceſſity or a remove to a new charge, hath not made their caſe more clear than mine was; and I am ſo much convinced of the piety and integrity of many, or the moſt of them, that I can be contented methinks, that my Soul ſhould be amongſt theirs, (though my eye-ſight as yet does differ,) to fare no otherwiſe than with them in ſtate and Conſcience, who have been my former fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and are yet quite free from all act or acts whatſoever, in or about this matter. I do conſider what I make my Pen to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I do beſeech the Lord, unto whom the ſecrets and reaſons of the heart is known, that I may ſtand in my ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, or in my reckoning between him and my Soul (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in Mans Court I ſtand) according to the ſame.</p>

But I am made ſenſible, that to be graſping after preſent things, is to catch an arm full of thorns: I am made to perceive on what a brink we yet are, and that a man muſt know firſt what he can ſwallow well, that hath a ſtomack for all that comes.

The real hazard of ſolid good, as compoſure of mind, a retired frame, and a whole conſcience, for the ſhew only of happineſs, and ceremony thereof, is one of the vanities of man. It is not the bulk of riches, or dignities, but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spirits, which is the content of them, and the ſervice of God by them, which is to be ſought. It is but a very little can be enjoyed of the whole World. I was verily faulty, that prudential perſwaſion, and ſeeming concernment, did draw me more haſtily, if not farther, in this thing, than elſe I ſhould have gone; And it is really ſuch an ugly thing to me, when one cannot down freely with every thing elſe, to be trapt into this, that I cannot endure it, do what I can; neither is it in the revolution of theſe thoughts which was my ſoar, can be my cure, but in the Abrenunciation of them.

I had rather have my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour Chriſt alone pleaſed with me, than all the Biſhops, Lords, and Rulers of the Land. The fine Needle work on the Cap (as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> I think, ſomewhere ſpeaks to that ſenſe) does not help the headach; Nor the gilded Slipper the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Shin. It is the confeſſion of evil, and the forſaking of evil, makes the Soul well: Let me but have the ſmile of God upon my Soul when I have done, and let others write for what they will, and get what they can. And what indeed were three or four hundred pound a year to reconciliation with God, and remiſſion of Sin? <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us</hi> (ſayes <hi>David</hi>) and it ſhall be more cauſe of gladneſs to the heart, than the increaſe of Corn and Wine.</p>

But if we ſhall deny our advantages to ſave our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and come after to find it nothing, or but a meer ſcruple for which we have relinquiſhed them and ſo are troubled for that, then may we go to God directly for our comfort, who we are ſure can eaſe us, and by the teſtimony alone of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, make up what we have loſt. It is a noble inſtance of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61796:60"/>famous Marqueſs of <hi>Vice,</hi> who when his Honours, and State, and Wife, and Children hung about him, could ſhake off all, as the drops of rain, from his Cloak at once, for the ſake of his Conſcience. From which contemplation, I will humbly in the preſence of the Lord, from henceforth lay down this rule (ingenuouſly acknowledging it to him, as my failing, that I had not laid it to my ſelf, <hi>animo obfirmato</hi> before) that when the Soul is in doubt about any thing, which it is like to be troubled for, either way when it is done, it muſt determine to take that way, which is moſt like to relieve it again, in that trouble. If my Conſcience can relieve me againſt my advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and my advantages cannot relieve me againſt my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then let my <hi>Iſaac</hi> be ſacrificed, and my hopes he caſt on the Lord, who can raiſe them up again if he ſees good, when they are ſlain, but let not a man diſpirit his Soul, and loſe the comfort of his mind, if not alſo the peace of his Conſcience, which is not to be recompenſed with the world. And yet need we not be ſo narrow-ſpirited towards God, his Church, or Cauſe, (which is the promoting holineſs and peace) but that as to others, and in other things, as to our ſelves, we may <hi>judge,</hi> that when a perſon hath found in the bottom of his Soul, wherein he is like to be moſt ſerviceable to this grand end, he need not <hi>hide himſelf among the ſtuff,</hi> from the Providences, which without ſin, lie before him. This being one top-ſtep of denying ones ſelf, to deny ſelf-denial in its ſeaſon. <hi>Through good report, and through evil report, by honour and diſhonour.</hi>

I wiſh rather an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Author, to embrace him in my love, than to ſcratch him with my Pen; whom I receive as another perſon of learning, induſtry, candour, and worth. I am now from my Study and Bookes, and cannot beſtow that time and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon his labours as they require; I ſhall ſit down only as it were, and looking over his leaves, point out the anſwers to what concerns me in it, which I have given already to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Author.</p>
               <p>His Book hath ſix Chapters. In the firſt (<hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 5.) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes twenty Diſtinctions which may paſs. In his ſecond, he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He cites learned Authors on both ſides, ſome deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ordination only to be a publick approbation and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and others a proteſtative miſſion, or collation of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-power, and then tells us, we may call it either of theſe, provided, we will acknowledge it to have the force of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> of that power. Unto which I have this to ſay, that if this perſon had beſtowed as many thoughts to compound theſe two Opinions, and ſhew us how they may ſtand together, as he hath ſhewed kindneſs in granting both of them to us, he might bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is his 14th. diſtinction therefore he hath laid down, as idle, and without uſe in him, that may take its place here, to wit, This Miniſterial power may be conſidered <hi>in foro Dei</hi> (or <hi>conſcientiae</hi>) and <hi>in foro huma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o.</hi> They are his own terms, if he had but been ſo happy alſo to apply them. See <hi>ante, Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 30. In the firſt conſideration (I have ſaid there) a man hath this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61796:65"/>power, and muſt have it before Orders, and ſo his firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (<hi>p.</hi> 11, 12.) from the Coronation of a King, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Magiſtrate, will make for us, and ſhew him how <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> follows the Office, and not gives it. In the ſecond conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, we will acknowledge it, that ordinarily <hi>extra caſum neceſſitatis,</hi> it come by Orders, and ſo his next two Arguments, (<hi>p.</hi> 13.) are anſwered, to wit, It is not enough that a man is <hi>qualified and deſires the Office;</hi> But being Ordained, he becomes <hi>a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iſter as he was not before.</hi> In this ſenſe, be it granted him, that Orders is a <hi>Condition,</hi> as he would have it, which being put, Office power does follow, and being denyed, is ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to wit, <hi>coram hominibus, as to the Church.</hi> And ſo that queſtion which he asks, <hi>Are all Prophets, are all Teachers?</hi> is ſo far from poſing of us, that we ſhall not need to anſwer him only, <hi>And have all gifts?</hi> although while the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. with <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.) makes the Gifts and Office to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is Orders, I will account my ſelf, gives a perſon his <hi>Church</hi>-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and transferts him <hi>ab eſſe Laico, ab eſſe Clericale,</hi> (if you will) <hi>in her Court.</hi> And this I hope does cut thoſe in the hamm quite, that will be <hi>running before they be ſent,</hi> to wit, before they be ſent by the Church. And yet while <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> a man hath his Gifts and Office, and ſo is a <hi>Miniſter before,</hi> in that reſpect, this Gentleman I hope will ſtand to his word, <hi>that there is not then, ſo much intrinſecal to the Ordinance, which may hinder its repetition.</hi> I pray let us ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61796:65"/>part, if I could once believe ſo, I might at next turn believe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the hands of a Biſhop alone, laid on a mans head, ſhall ſetch dow the Holy Ghoſt (or this ſpiritual effect) upon him ſtreight, when the hands and prayers of twenty Presbyters can do nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which, I were fitted to believe even what you would have next. And yet ſhall we leave open a gapp here, as may let in conſuon into the Miniſtry? No, there is a middle and right way to be taken, and that is (as I judge) what I have propoſed in this Diſtinction thus applied, which I therefore humbly offer to the ſober in heart to conſider of, and as for his other Arguments that follow, (<hi>p.</hi> 14.) out of the <hi>London</hi> Divines, they are anſwered, <hi>ante Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 48. to 51.</p>

Methinks, although it be true that the Biſhop in his account does Ordain a man again to the Office, and will look on it as a proper Ordination, the man himſelf yet, may take it, having I will ſuppoſe, a call to a new place, as an Ordination to a particular work, or otherwiſe, as a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confirmation only of his former Miniſtry, and ſo declare it reſolutely when he does it. Why may he not blend in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, what this man diſtinguiſhes in notion? And as for the <hi>Form</hi> only, which is but mans compoſure, what if it be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſ-uſed, ſo long as it will ſerve that turn in ſome ſort we take it for, though it were framed indeed at firſt for another?

               <p>His next Chapter contains twenty argumentative interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unto which I will ſay in general, If the Office-power a Miniſter hath given him, <hi>coram Eccleſia</hi> by Orders, which is I count in it ſelf, nothing elſe but the repute of us as Miniſters, or reception in that relation, as we ſtand in before toward God, being called of him, be to be put in the predicament of Relation, that one axiome only, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In particular I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, The caſe is the ſame as in the repetition of the Oath of Allegiance, to the Magiſtrate. <hi>Ante, p.</hi> 57. The ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>ſpecifically</hi> the ſame, to wit, the matter of the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61796:66"/>and the repetition which makes it differ <hi>numerically</hi> only, is the command of our Superiours. Add to this that inſtance, 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 30.23. Say the ſame of it, and apply it to Orders.</p>
               <p>To the Second, It is anſwered at large; <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>To his Third, and Fifth, I would ask whether <hi>Joſephs</hi> being Chriſts <hi>reputed</hi> Father, was a Relation? If it were, I ſhould anſwer what is hinted before: But to chooſe what I think, Ordination (I will ſay) adds no new being, nor begets any new Relation, but declares or teſtifies that to the Church which is already. As when a Couple have mutually given their conſent, the conjugal Relation ariſes from thence before God, and if they be married after, both by the Magiſtrate, and Miniſter, it is but the ſame thing new declared, and that is all. And thus I remember among the Arguments <hi>Voetius</hi> uſes to prove, that <hi>Ordinatio non eſt Fundamentum Miniſterii,</hi> he produces this for one, <hi>Conjugii Fundamentum eſt mutuus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus non vero externa ſolemnizatio</hi> which he confirms out of the Lawyers.</p>
               <p>To his Fourth, between, See <hi>Ante, p.</hi> 90.</p>
               <p>To his Sixth, Chriſt, I conceive, exerts not any Act in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as to collation of power (whatever he do as to his Grace or Spirit) but the Charter of his Goſpel only, or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is his ſtanding Act, and the Church declares a man in Office according to the ſame.</p>
               <p>To his Seventh, Re-ordination is an injury indeed on the part of thoſe that require it to the nullifying our former Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but not, I hope, on the part of thoſe that ſubmit to it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the uſe of that Miniſtry they cannot enjoy otherwiſe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity excuſes by the verdict of this mans own twelfth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>To the Eight, We muſt conceive no otherwiſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture with Miniſterial power in Orders, than of the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Regal in the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uguration of Princes, the repetition whereof (inſtanced by me in Scripture) does I hope, anſwer this Interrogation.</p>
               <p>To the Ninth, and Tenth, The Deaconſhip as well as the Prieſthood in our Caſe is taken only we know by way of Form for the Canonical Stamp upon our former Miniſtry, and let a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61796:66"/>man lock to it only that he avoid lying in his own Anſwers, and I do judge, ſuppoſing him at preſent diſpoſed, and under the need of it, that it is to be born by him, when he cannot help it, as a Chriſtian bears affronts and indignities for the ſake of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To the Eleventh, Neceſſity that knows no Law is not bounded by Number.</p>
               <p>To the Twelfth, Our people are to be taught by us, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (as we do) that our former Orders are valid, which prevents theſe ſcruples.</p>
               <p>To the Thirteenth, and Fourteenth, The arguing is perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as to our Rulers, if they will pleaſe to hearken to it, but the Caſe of Impoſition, is not the ſame with the Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>To the Fifteenth, This is prevented by the explication of our account of, and ſenſe about our re-ordaining.</p>
               <p>To the Sixteenth, what ſhould hinder, but a man may pray in Faith for Gods Grace or Bleſſing upon his Office or Work more than once?</p>
               <p>To the Seventeenth, I had thought to have found ſomething againſt Prelacy in the Abſtract, as Anti C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the Eighteenth, If Re-ordination be but proved <hi>in theſi,</hi> it is fair for me, for I will confeſs, that as it is cloathed with all its circumſtances <hi>in hypotheſi</hi> it is very hard to be digeſted, and this good man methinks ſhould not go to make it harder, while he ſits down ſo induſtriouſly, as it were, to prick thorns into his Brethrens hearts, that are herein too tender and bleed already, There are 27 Particulars raked up out of the words of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or Arch-deacon, as incongruous in the Form, which let them look to that ſpeak them: For my part, I care not to have it ſaid, in regard of the change of the Churches Court from Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty; Yet do I aſſent to him ſo far, that whatever words or engagements a man utters for himſelf, he hath need to be very tender of them, inſomuch that I my ſelf find ſome kind of guilt reflected on me, methinks (I crave mercy) in one paſſage I thought not on in the leaſt before, to wit, the firſt Queſtion in the Deaconſhip is, <hi>Do you think you are moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you this Office and Miniſtration?</hi> I took this Curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily as no more than, Do you think you have Gods Call to the Miniſtry? And the Anſwer being ſo gentle, <hi>I think ſo,</hi> it paſſed with me without more thought: A man may (I think) ſay he is moved by the Holy Ghoſt to his duty, and while he ſubmits to this <hi>Form</hi> only, for the confirming his Miniſtry, I cannot deny but this may be ſaid; yet let the words be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken (as this man does urge them) of that Work and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Deaconſhip, as diſtinct from the Prieſthood, if I were put upon it now, I could hardly ſay it again without ſome explication. It muſt be conceived therefore, when the Biſhop diſpenſes with the Canons, as to the Ordaining a man Deacon and Presbyter in one day, there is no expreſſion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary there to, but he may diſpenſe with likewiſe; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, let every man be ſure to crave his liberty accordingly, as to the variation of any ſuch expreſſion, which is againſt his Conſcience, and that is the proper, clear, and full remedy in this matter. If poſſibly one Biſhop ſhould deny a man ſo poor a thing as this (which I conceive none will) let him go to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>To the Nineteenth, I conſent with full conviction, that it is wholſome and prudent adviſe, for a man that goes about this buſineſs, to conſider firſt with himſelf well, how far his Conſcience will go, and whether he can thereby attain his end by it, to wit, as the getting into, ſo the keeping his Miniſtry got, which if he can, with a ſatisfied heart, by a full confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or His Majeſties gracious indulgence either, it is well, I ſhall be glad (however it be with my ſelf) if my labour be not in vain in the Lord unto any.</p>
               <p>To his Twentieth, I acknowledge the ſame as to the main, but crave the Applications of his Thirteenth Diſtinction, and Propoſition.</p>

See <hi>Ante,</hi> p. 44. And loe here the Apple of that ſtrife (or paring of it) about which they contend.</p>

Why this only, <hi>It might be judged an occaſional Embaſſy.</hi> But how I pray could he be ſent by them on this Embaſſy without the Office? <hi>The exerciſe of Authority ſuppoſes the Existence,</hi> ſayes he ſomewhere himſelf. And how could he have the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice according to him unleſs he was Ordained? Here then is a double Ordination by men: for, as for any immediate Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Barnabas</hi> from Chriſt before, as of <hi>Paul,</hi> we read not; And this Perſon does hold, that a men cannot be a Miniſter, or have his Office, but by Orders: And yet does the fellow-inſtance with this take much deeper root in my Soul. <hi>Paul</hi> we are ſure was call'd and ſent by Chriſt himſelf immediately to the Gentiles, and yet Ordained after with <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Now if a man may be Ordained by men, who was Ordained before by Chriſt himſelf, how much rather I pray may he be Ordained again, that is Ordained only before by men? And thus doth that which he anſwers to weaken this, add ſtrength to it; which is, <hi>A twofold Ordination, one extraordinary, and the other ordinary cannot juſtifie a twofold Ordination that is ordinary.</hi> But what is this oppoſing words to real things? It juſtifies it I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61796:68"/>ſay the rather. The call to the Miniſtry is either <hi>Inward,</hi> which lies in Gods gifting and inclining a perſon for the Office (as he ſpeaks) or <hi>Outward.</hi> This call from <hi>without,</hi> we muſt know is either Extraordinary or Ordinary; which by the way may convince this Author of a farther defect in his apprehenſion, while he would make the Inward call in us, to anſwer that which was Extraodinary then. Well, <hi>Paul</hi> is called Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by Chriſt, at firſt from without, <hi>appearing to him on purpoſe that he might ſend him,</hi> &amp;c. and yet called again by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for all that. Here then is an <hi>external call</hi> we ſee <hi>double.</hi> What can he poſſibly ſay to this? Yes, What can he ſay to the bottom of the matter? The reaſon why Divines and he do hold the unlawfulneſs of Re-ordination, is becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a man is made a Miniſter already by his firſt Orders; But he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Two thing he hath to anſwer; 1. <hi>Some ſay this Ordination was to a higher Office.</hi> But who ſaies ſo? When Chriſt had made <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> what Office I pray can be given by man after, higher than this? 2. <hi>We deny</hi> (he adds) <hi>this to be a proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>tion.</hi> But though he does ſo, I do believe there is not ſo much as one of the Ancients can be produced to have dreamed of ſuch a denial; and preſuming that there is not 10 to 100 of all Divines elſe, that ever interpreted this place otherwiſe, than of Ordination, I may conclude (I hope) that Orders is and muſt be that, and nothing elſe but that, which is, or may be gathered of it here, rather than to ſay with this perſon, that that which is here, is not to be accounted Ordination. While therefore he endeavours to prove by ſeveral particulars, that theſe perſons were not Ordained here to their Office, let us by <hi>Ordaining to the Office,</hi> underſtand what ſuch learned men as are of his mind do, that is, Ordained for the conferring of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Ut Epiſcopalem gratiam largiretur;</hi> He little thinks how he is plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat he allows it here to do, what is the repetition of it, to be ſo pleaded againſt, if occaſion be?

                  </gap>o, know, what is more material for him to prove if
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61796:68"/>he can, to wit, that Ordination preciſely taken, as diſtinct from Election, is any thing any where elſe in Scripture, than it is here. If he cannot do this, he may put up, and have done; If he can, yet will it ſerve our turn, ſo that a twofold Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination however, will be proved to our hands. And here while we are upon this Conſideration, and I my ſelf with theſe Authors, do diſtinguiſh ſome where between Ordaining to the Office and the Work, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as it is here. I muſt offer theſe two or three things by way of Quaere.
<list>
                     <item>1. Whether all Ordination by man be not indeed to the Work? <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Ex.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.26.</item>

                     <item>3. Whereas ſome do diſtinguiſh between the power of Preaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, and an outward faculty to exerciſe the ſame (or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is no ſuch <hi>ſubtil or crafty device</hi> as he imagines, but the moſt honeſt plain truth <hi>in</hi> the Lord, of this buſineſs, as I judge, and am humbly perſwaded too farther, <hi>from</hi> him; apprehended by Proteſtants ordinarily, though preſſed to a more clear, or (to ſay rather) <hi>full</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof by me, than perhaps by others. This appears I account, from the <hi>general</hi> nature of ſuch Solemnities, and ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61796:69"/>to be argued from its own light, as <hi>home est animal, &amp; animal ſubſtantia</hi> (yet not without convenient patronage, neither from Scripture, (<hi>ante p.</hi> 74.) and therefore the Arguments of this Author which he offers only from this particular place of <hi>Act.</hi> 13. might be waved as to him eaſily, by ſaying that, though this was not the end of that <hi>benedictory diſmiſſion</hi> there, yet may it be the end always of every <hi>proper Ordination.</hi> But foraſmuch as I do take that to be <hi>Ordination,</hi> and for ought I know, ſo full and proper, as proper can be, I ſhall chooſe to conſider a little more, what we find there in that place. In the firſt place, we find manifeſtly a call of the Holy Ghoſt. This call, <hi>ſeparate me,</hi> I can underſtand no otherwiſe than as I do the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> that <hi>went before</hi> on <hi>Timothy,</hi> to wit, to be by Revelation, to ſome of thoſe Prophets and Teachers, there (for hence it is probable that they are told us to be Prophets, when it had been enough to ſay only they had been Teachers elſe) who being as it is ſaid, <hi>in the Church, and Miniſtring to the Lord,</hi> we muſt conceive the Body of them met together with them, and when theſe Prophets and Teachers, to whom this was revealed, do in the midſt of the Congregation, thus ſolemnly lay hands on theſe perſons according to the ſpirits bidding of them, what can be more plain in the thing its ſelf, than that this is an open teſtification of that call or publick approbation in the face of that Church, which being the moſt famous than in Chriſtendom, the notice of it, and conſequently eſteem of them accordingly, does neceſſarily follow upon the ſame. And what now are his ſeveral particulars againſt this, if any one were minded to ſet himſelf to anſwer the ſame?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4th. and 5th. and 6th. <hi>Apari;</hi> From Marriage, from the Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and from the Lords Prayer, whereof he ſpeaks <hi>p.</hi> 91. <hi>ad</hi> 95. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here I perceive very good confirmation. <hi>The formal Contract</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>which may be, and often is, before the Marriage, gives the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Again, <hi>The proper end is the ſatisfaction of the world, and therefore if the firſt ſolemnity give not ſatisfaction, a ſecond may be, without profanation.</hi> Juſt thus do I conceive of Orders; He hath ſpoken my parallel thoughts for me, as to Re-ordination. So likewiſe, for the other inſtance he is already foreſtalled. See <hi>ante p.</hi> 56.57.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7th. From Chriſts perſonal Baptiſm; This I urged
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61796:69"/>in my Book, thus only, to wit, That an Ordinance may be uſed by a perſon who is not capable of its principal end, becauſe there may be more ends than one of an Ordinance, and he may be capable of ſome other of them, though not that. Now what means here theſe heapings of Commentators and particulars, to ſhew that there was ſome end for which Chriſt ſubmitted to Baptiſm? Who ever was ſo impious to think otherwiſe? That I ſaid, or ſay, is <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm in Scripture, is <hi>the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance for remiſſion of ſin;</hi> Chriſt is not capable of this end, yet baptized. What is there in theſe three leaves to contradict this, unleſs it be his firſt anſwer only, from <hi>A Lapide</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſtus quaſi reus &amp; penitens</hi> Johanni <hi>ſe ſiſt it</hi> &amp;c. But will indeed ſuch Doctrine hold that Chriſt Jeſus did repent as well as dye in our behalf? What if I ſhould uſe here thoſe words he hath upon me in the next page, about Re-baptization, <hi>Oh how ſtrong was that temptation that trapan'd ſo learned a perſon into</hi> Antinomianiſm? But I dare not ſo ludicrouſly alſo add his Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>ad</hi> 110. He produces ten interpretations of <hi>Act.</hi> 19. to wave that ſingle inſtance of Rebaptization. That which I ſhall obſerve here, only is, how hard it is for a man to be well read in Books, and not ſacrifice to them, to the ſpoil of his own judgment, and how the ſtrength of a man is indeed weakneſs. There can be but one true meaning or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text; If any one then of theſe ten be true, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nine are certainly falſe, and when he propoſes all as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, it follows neceſſarily, that it muſt be ten to one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he takes be right or no. And as for that he hath choſe, though he may be extolled that he hath ſaid ſo much as to make it ſeem poſſible, yet while it is ſo much ſtrained at the very ſight, it is leſs probable than the laſt, and moſt anciently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his interpretations. For my part, I hold it baſe, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any truth becauſe humane authority would face us down. There are to me here theſe four things to be held.
<list>
                     <item>1. That theſe perſons were baptized, and re-baptized, as the former Author more judiciouſly (from <hi>Voſſius</hi>) as leſs nicely, hath acknowledged.</item>
                     <item>2. That both theſe Baptiſms were in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o Chriſt, and ſo one and the ſame ſo far as I ſay, to wit, as to the Author, matter, form, and main end, and yet not altogether the ſame ſo, but one was <hi>John</hi>'s Baptaſm, and the other Chriſt's, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61796:70"/>they might be re-baptized.</item>
                     <item>3. That the reaſon of the doing muſt be gathered from the Text it ſelf, and that intimateth, that theſe Diſciples underſtood not their former Baptiſm, at leaſt ſo as they ought, either they knew not that they were Baptized into Chriſt at all, or not ſufficiently that Chriſt, into whom they were Baptized, ſeeing they were Baptized into him as to come, when he was dark to the World.</item>
                  </list>
Now Chriſt being come, and fully revealed, the Apoſtles inſtructs them more fully, and explicitely herein, and ſo baptizes them <hi>formally,</hi> as <hi>Diodate</hi> ſpeaks, and expreſly in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus. As happily it was upon higher inſtruction, it may be ſaid, into an higher <hi>Form,</hi> but not into another <hi>School,</hi> or Church State, and ſo be ſtrong for us, <hi>Ante, p.</hi> 90. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it follows, according to what I have ſaid, that though the univerſal judgement of the Church ſtands good againſt Re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization now, yet was there <hi>a particular</hi> Reaſon once in the Church, why a perſon might be re-baptized. And this does ſerve my turn, that there is not that hainous dread in the nature of the thing it ſelf; and yet ſo long as this particular reaſon could not endure any longer than the interval wherein Baptiſm was adminiſtred into Chriſt <hi>to come,</hi> which is now ceaſed, I am not <hi>Trapan'd into Re-baptization,</hi> as this man, <hi>Non ſatis quidem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuo vultu,</hi> does ſpeak, but may diſ-approve of the ſame now together with the Catholick Church, as well as any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg</hi> 9. From Chriſts own Re-ordaining his Apoſtles. To this he ſpeaks <hi>p.</hi> 111. <hi>ad.</hi> 115. And this indeed I do ſtand upon, and have there fully already prevented all that I think can be oppoſed; and what he hath elſe may paſs only for illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſuppoſe he himſelf will not expect I ſhould add any more See. <hi>p.</hi> 76. <hi>ad.</hi> 80.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. From the double <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in two Texts in the two Epiſtles; Upon which this Author hath ſpoken methinks ſo ſetly, gravely, and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that all I can ſay is, that he hath made me to believe ſomething more probable of that which I took before as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible only. And as for the two Authorities of mine, he farther quotes here in the end, I have not the Books at hand (where I am) to examine them. This he diſcourſes <hi>p.</hi> 116. <hi>ad.</hi> 122. Where he ends his Animadverſions.</p>
               <p>After all then, in both theſe Authors, there is the Objection of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61796:70"/>the Covenant, which though I would fain wave as extrinſical to Re-ordination it ſelf, &amp; for my own part, being not concerned in it, yet does it ſtill recurr to my mind, ſo that I doubt I ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found faithful to my Brethren in the Caſe, if I ſpeak not ſomething at leaſt to that alſo before I leave. Unto this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I tis conſiderable firſt, whether that which is ſaid ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Presbyterian, that the Biſhop does not Ordain <hi>quâ Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> but <hi>quâ Presbyter</hi> (See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. expreſs with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.) or <hi>quâ Preſident</hi> at moſt of <hi>that</hi> Presbytery, is not only that which is true, but gives allay alſo, to this matter?. If it does not, or not what is ſufficient, yet taking this in however, let us know next There are ſome things which may be unlawful at one time to do, or to be done, and at another be unlawful to be omitted, and not done. Let me ask a perſon every way elſe diſpoſed, whether he does not think it his duty to follow his Miniſtry, and unlawful for him to forſake the ſame, were it not for this only? If he thinks ſo, it follows, that though, ſo long as he could uſe his Miniſtry without Epiſcopal Orders, he might judge himſelf bound againſt taking of them; Yet now, when without theſe Orders he cannot uſe his Miniſtry (if the times prove indeed ſtill ſo hard) and ſo to refuſe the ſame, is by conſequence, to do that which he judges, as to him, is ſin, to wit, the quitting the Miniſtry he is engaged in; Here if he thinks that he ſtands bound by his Covenant ſtill (ſuppoſing him ſatisfied of Re-ordination otherwiſe, for therefore do I put this Objection laſt when all elſe is done) he makes that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Engagement, intended by him only to Piety, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him a Bond of Iniquity; in which caſe, I think all Divines are clear in their Solution. The matter of an Oath no doubt muſt be a thing lawful, if a thing then lawful to be done, or omitted before, become now unlawful, the <hi>matter</hi> of the Oath does ceaſe, and <hi>ceſſante materia ceſſat obligatio.</hi> I dare not tender this, but with all due ſerious caution, tenderneſs, and ſubmiſſion. Let the concern'd look more to it.</p>
               <p>In his fifth Chapter he hath liberally propoſed his Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, above all he hath beſides, is worthy to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: He will yield to Examination from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. To the Biſhops Approbation upon the ſame. To a Licence from <hi>Act.</hi> 21.37, 39. To a Benediction from <hi>Act.</hi> 20 32. To Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, as a Sign of conſent, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.14. And all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61796:71"/>this, both upon a mans undertaking a new Charge, and alſo upon the diſſolution of his legal title, in the ſame. Nay let me add his own words in the cloze, <hi>There is nothing that I can deviſe about Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the Biſhop, upon the remove of a man unto a new Charge: Upon which, if this freſh Author yields a little farther, it is not without the ſame Foundation; For if the Work, and Office (or the Work of the Office in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and a particular Charge) may be diſtinguiſhed as to a new place; why not alſo as to the old, when it is neceſſity puts them upon the diſtinction, in either? Theſe Conceſſions I take therefore from both, as to the main upon the matter, to be what I have contended for. I deſire none to make uſe of me that have not need of me, as ſuch more particularly have, who enter, or have entred a new place; And when any do it, I humbly lay this charge on them, that they look on this matter no otherwiſe but as a legal eſtabliſhment, or the Canonical Stamp of allowance (as I have expreſſed it) of their former Vocation; which they may pardon the rather, becauſe that Orders it ſelf (as I account) conſidered aright, comes to nothing in the nature of it, otherwiſe than this. And as for this inveſtiture with power as they call it, which does ſo ſtick, As I judge, with both theſe Authors, that it is in this point in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſumm of our diſpute does lye, and the bent of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe therefore hath been driven thereat: So am I perſwaded, that what I have ſaid, really, may ſatisfie the unpraeocupated in judgement. And I muſt add, that though there be ſome Circumſtances about the ordering otherwiſe, which have been to me very ſore, and do require care in the prevention, and good ſatisfaction, according to a mans temper before-hand; yet as to this particular meerly, it ſeems to me as I underſtand the ſame (and the words are not our part) to have ſo little hurt in it truly, that of all the reſt I know of to moleſt, I could methinks be ſooneſt ſatisfied in this. And if theſe Authors
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61796:71"/>do indeed ſtick at all the reſt for the ſake of this only, they are huge Conformiſts methinks I may ſay, that <hi>ſtick at nothing.</hi> However this be, while we ſee how tenderly theſe candid Brethren do offer towards Submiſſion, in point of Conſcience in the thing, there is all the reaſon in the world, that our Church Rulers, who have the ſame thoughts of this inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as they, ſhould come to compoſition with them. To this effect, this Author does ſpend his ſixth and laſt Chapter, by way of Petition, and pathetical Conſiderations, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to it, wherein therefore I have nothing to oppoſe, or anſwer, but to joyn heart and ink along with him. In the mean while, winding up the Controverſie (or the Agreement rather) which is between us in this manner.</p>
               <p>Re-ordination may be conſidered in the Impoſition, or our Submiſſion. For the Impoſition, we agree, we are ſorry for it, and dare not juſtifie it. For the Submiſſion, it is either <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> or meerly in compliance with the Times, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears injurious to our former Orders, and virtually to juſtifie the impoſing, and ſo we agree likewiſe. I dare not approve this, but ſo far rather, as I have been any wayes culpable, I repent it: Or upon neceſſity, ſo that a man cannot elſe have the uſe of his Miniſtry, and in this Caſe it is, I ſtate Re-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

In <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> I am willing to come to them, and joyn thus far, that if we take the Form exactly in every Circumſtance, and its appurtinances, it is hard to be ſwallowed, and certainly requires condeſcention, which if it may be obtained in general, in a new mould, it were beſt; if not, every individual perſon muſt conſider well the whole matter for himſelf (which I charge him in the Lord, for the delivery of my own Soul, and his, carefully to do) and then to crave, or take his liberty in thoſe things which are againſt his Conſcience, or elſe forbear. And if any good men ſhall do
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61796:72"/>thus, with comfort to themſelves, and people, ſo that as to the main they are ſatisfied, I ſhall not, I hope, have cauſe to repent of what I have written, nor theſe Brethren of mine, of their kind Conceſſions, for which I thank them, and cannot take my leave of them, without this due commendation.

If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe will be granted, yet we hope at leaſt for <hi>Charls</hi> the Second, and His Declaration ſake, you will not deny to the tender all due regard in Circumſtances, as in Expreſſions, Subſcription, and otherwiſe, that thoſe that are willing to come on, may come off with all fair, meet, and ſatisfying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. I muſt confeſs, I am one of the meaneſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthieſt of my Brethren, to take ſuch a petition into my mouth, in their behalf; but yet one whom the Lord hath called forth to be concerned in it more than any; and as I am a perſon more indifferent than others, not looſed from my own ſhell to ſtudy a Side, or be engaged to a Party, I may the rather ſpeak the truth to you, as near as I can, in Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed God, that this thing, ſince I did it, hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my heart with many thoughts, and much trouble; And if I believe that Providence hath a hand in every thing that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall be worſe than one of thoſe <hi>upon whom the Tower of</hi> Siloh <hi>fell,</hi> if I ſhould not be deeply ſenſible of the Caſe of my Brethren, whoſe Spirits are in doubt, and groaning under the perplexities of this, and the like Impoſitions; And therefore, after I have been put to ſo heavy a diſtreſs, to clear up my own relief, and have endeavoured (according to my tenuity) to ſatisfie them, that if it be ſtill impoſed, their Conſciences may not be wounded for want of ſatisfaction in the doing; ſo muſt I alſo apply my ſelf to you from the Lord, and his hand upon me in it (which you muſt pardon therefore, and put accordingly upon his account) for that only ſure, and proper remedy in the thing, which is, to prevent the wound quite, by removing the occaſion. You may be happily loath to have any think, that leſs than the Miniſterial Function it ſelf, is given by your hands in Orders, but be you adured, if you continue requiring Re-ordination in our Caſe, your honour here will but turn to a formality, and the truth will be ſought out for our Apology.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged by you, and by me, that this Re-ordination is ordinarily at leaſt, if not quite againſt the hair
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61796:73"/>of the Literate World, whether Councils, School-men, or Fathers, in ſo much that I muſt needs be afraid, the Truth it ſelf, were it not for the grand neceſſity put upon us elſe at this ſeaſon, would hardly bear me out in the defence of it, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, ſo unpleaded for by Divines Ancient and Modern, ſo abſonant to the ears of your ſelves, that even you that require it, will not own it, but when you have done, would have us count our former Orders null, leſt it be monſtrous; And if any of us do defend the ſame, and are ſure to be oppoſed by thoſe that oppoſe you, yet unleſs we will come up to this (which is to acknowledge our ſelves Intruders, and Uſurpers of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry all the time before) we cannot for ought I ſee have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in you, which is indeed ſo hard, and injurious (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when our former Biſhops have allowed what I aſſume) that I cannot but bring my complaint to you, and lay it at your doors.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61796:74"/>not ſo in the reformed Churches, who have had more light ſince them of old. It is not ſo <hi>according to the Law of God,</hi> with that worthy <hi>Dr.</hi> mentioned. <hi>Non ita fuit ab initio,</hi> with St. <hi>Jerome;</hi> and whether the Law of God or Canons of Men muſt take place, judge you. It is this we ſtand upon, when a man is in Orders, whether by Presbyters or Biſhops, he is Chriſts Miniſter according to his Word, put in Office by him. You are perſonages now of quality, as of great learning, ſo of much honeſty, and would not (we believe) do the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in your dealings unto any in other matters; Here now is a matter of as great and manifeſt wrong, as can be, which your opinion does us, and that opinion that does wrong, is a ſinful opinion; to wit, it takes away that Office from a perſon which Chriſt hath given him, and holds it null. If it was a grievous thing in theſe times to put a Miniſter out of his <hi>Place,</hi> what is it to put a Miniſter out of his <hi>Office?</hi> A Thief is not more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than ſuch an opinion, which (believe it) ſhall be brought to the Bar one day, to anſwer unto Chriſt for what it does. There is no great Perſon, or Parliament men, that holds any honour from the King, if he hath an Engliſh ſpirit, but will venture his life, rather than loſe his honour, while the King is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to continue it; And can you or they think, that we who have been Ordained Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhould ſo eaſily deſert that Miniſtry as not valid, or not maintain it to be good? You may expect as well, we ſhould deny the <hi>Lord that bought us,</hi> as the Lord that ſent us, or recede from that authority which we received neither from you, nor the Presbytery, but from him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We can rather dye here, than yield to any.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61796:74"/>we do hope that you alſo ſhall be enjoyned to frame ſuch a form, or alter this ſo, as that the Prerogative of Chriſt be not touched, nor our former Miniſtry, or the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches ſlurred, and then it may be happily well enough in this matter.</p>
               <p>And alas indeed! what ſhall we make of all thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubmit to be Re-ordained otherwiſe? Shall they be Jews or Samaritanes? Miniſters or not? I know not how they may look on the Miniſtry, that have greatneſs, wealth, and honour, tumbling in upon them with it; but as for others, that deſire or expect only to get their bread and raiment by it, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the work, their buſineſs, and their account, which makes them groan under the weight, with a <hi>who is ſufficient for</hi> theſe things? If I know any thing of fleſh and blood, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a thought almoſt more pleaſing to it, than to conceive, that if the times will now deſtroy their former Orders, or not let them paſs, then may they look on Providence as giving them a diſcharge from their labour; and conſequently that there can hardly be a piece of ſelf-denial more cloſe, than for a man ſincerely upon that account, to tye up himſelf by this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new (when he is willing to be free) as the likelieſt way to ſet his mind at quiet from that temptation, and force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his work, if his heart be indeed fully up, and without flaw, even with this; And will your honours now I pray, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with the fleſh and blood of ſinful man, that becauſe ſome perſons will not ſubmit to you in this thing, you will find a means how to gratifie the ſame to the full? Truly, if you were indeed able to take away a mans Office, as eaſily as you may his Place, it would be giving them ſuch a play day, that it cannot be ſaid how many would gladly accept there ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; But when the Office remains indelible, As I muſt tell them, that ſuppoſing this be ſo, that their Orders will paſs, though they may look on Providence thereby to diſpenſe with them for all that which they may not do in their calling without new Orders, if their Conſcience cannot ſubmit to them (for if it can, they know what they have to do) yet will it not diſpenſe with them, or acquit them from any thing they can do, only upon their old, and there is no doubt but much ſtill may be done, and will be permitted to any Miniſters that are peaceable, and able in this caſe: So muſt I tell you,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61796:75"/>that this is a better way to puniſh ſuch for their non-ſubmiſſion, than to pleaſure their fleſh for it; Let them be held ſtill for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Vineyard, that the Mr. may not be offended with you who hath employed them, nor their Talents be wrapt up in a Napkin, or the people be deprived of their pains, though it be only by permiſſion, as aſſiſtants to others for the good of the Church, and help of them, when the <hi>Titles</hi> themſelves, with Inſtitution and Induction are beſtowed, only according to the Law of the Land. This is that will ſatisfie thoſe that are truly pious at the heart, and ſtick hereat only upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; For let them but glorifie God, and ſave mens Souls, and they have their main end, being deſirous to do Gods work with a little, and leave their wages with him; And this will alſo beſt fetch in others, who when they refuſe only out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, or unſound ends, they will ſoon grow weary, while they ſee (as I am ſpeaking) they ſhall have work as they are Miniſters of Chriſt, but preferment only as Miniſters according to the conſtitution of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Though this be hard, I heartily wiſh it may not be worſe, but humbly hope and crave it may be better. And having now taken upon me to ſpeak to your Honours, I muſt importune you yet farther in the Name of the Lord, more in general than about this thing only, to wit, for the multitudes of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who have their faces towards Sion, in a way of different perſwaſions. Let not my Lords think it to be meerly pride, and humour deſign and faction, perverſeneſs and obſtinacy, or fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm altogether, but rather in many a ſerious Spirit, a zeal of God, a care of their Souls, a breathing after purity, at leaſt <hi>Epictetus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

Alas, what were the parting with a Ceremony or two for <hi>Englands</hi> peace? What were it, when you have all that Money and Dignity can yield you, and are ſharing it amongſt you, to leave others poor Conſcience for their part? Let them but ſee a countenance of hearty Piety above Ceremony, of Grace above Prophaneneſs, and that you let Gods Children alone in thoſe things wherein they do you no hurt, it will bring them very near to you. Oh that men were brought to this paſs, that they were heartily willing to let their Brethren come in, and be one with them! It is pitty certainly, that any Spirits ſhould be ſuch, that the ſame things will not content them ſometimes, with the good leave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of their Brethren, unleſs they may have them in ſpite and oppoſition; And why ſhould any uſe violence, where more may be wonn with courteſie? <hi>Then</hi> Abner <hi>called to</hi> Joab, <hi>and ſaid, ſhall the Sword devour for ever?

If the Chriſtian that only by his example, gives occaſion to another to do the ſame thing he does, before his Conſcience be ſatisfied, ſhall judge himſelf that he hath ſinned, and dare not do the ſame again, leſt the wrath of God be kindled; what ſhall we think of ſuch (if there be any ſuch) that are ready to provide all ſeverity and rigor to force mens Conſciences, which for to do were the higheſt of ſcandal?
